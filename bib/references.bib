However, no similar meta-analyses have been conducted in the humanities and social sciences. Because major dissimilarities may exist between different fields or domain of knowledge, there can be issues with transferring research findings or knowledge across fields. We therefore meta-analyzed 104 studies that used assessment scores to compare the learning achieved by college students in humanities and social science programs under active instruction versus traditional lecturing. Student performance on assessment scores was found to be higher by 0.489 standard deviations under active instruction (Z = 6.521, p < 0.001, k = 111, N = 15,896). The relative beneficial effect of active instruction was found to be higher for some course subject matters (i.e., Sociology, Psychology, Language, Education, and Economics), for smaller (≤ 20 students) rather than larger class or group sizes, and for upper level rather than introductory courses. Analyses further suggest that these findings are not affected by publication bias.},

But what do students think of role-play? This study surveyed 144 students after a role-play activity in a history course and asked them to identify what they gained from the activity and if it encouraged them to learn more about the topic. The results found conflicting student views: though a large majority found the activity beneficial, a small minority gained little from the exercise. It is argued that role-play can be counterproductive for weak and/or unprepared students. Role-play may be a popular teaching method but teachers should consider how format and preparation can impact learning outcomes.},

For each personality style, we assess three models: (1) a dialogue-only model that conveys personality through dialogue, (2) an animated human model that expresses personality solely through dialogue, and (3) an animated human model that expresses personality through both dialogue and body and facial animations. The results indicate that all models are positively perceived regarding both personality and learning outcomes. Models with high personality traits are perceived as more engaging than those with low personality traits. We provide a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of perceived personality traits, learning parameters, and user experiences based on participant ratings of the model types and personality styles, as well as users' responses to open-ended questions.},

Recently, films such as <italic>Tron: Legacy</italic> and <italic>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</italic> have produced highly realistic characters. In the real-time domain, there is also a need to deliver realistic virtual characters, with the increase in popularity of interactive drama video games (such as <italic>L.A. Noire™</italic> or <italic>Heavy Rain™</italic> ). There have been mixed reactions from audiences to lifelike characters used in movies and games, with some saying that the increased realism highlights subtle imperfections, which can be disturbing. Some developers opt for a stylized rendering (such as cartoon-shading) to avoid a negative reaction [Thompson 2004]. In this paper, we investigate some of the consequences of choosing realistic or stylized rendering in order to provide guidelines for developers for creating appealing virtual characters. We conducted a series of psychophysical experiments to determine whether render style affects how virtual humans are perceived. Motion capture with synchronized eye-tracked data was used throughout to animate custom-made virtual model replicas of the captured actors. </p>},

It is important to research children's experiences with consumer devices which use AI techniques because these shape their understanding of AI and its capabilities. We conducted a mixed-methods study (questionnaires and interviews) with primary-school children aged 6-11 in Scotland to establish children's understanding of how voice-based CAs work, how they perceive their cognitive abilities, agency and other human-like qualities, their awareness and trust of privacy aspects when using CAs and what they perceive as appropriate verbal interactions with CAs. Most children overestimated the CAs' intelligence and were uncertain about the systems' feelings or agency. They also lacked accurate understanding of data privacy and security aspects, and believed it was wrong to be rude to conversational assistants. Exploring children's current understanding of AI-supported technology has educational implications; such findings will enable educators to develop appropriate materials to address the pressing need for AI literacy.},

Due to their increasing popularity, many empirical studies have been devoted to exploring the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The proliferation of experimental studies has highlighted the need to summarize and synthesize the inconsistent findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. However, few reviews focused on the meta‐analysis of the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The present study performed a meta‐analysis of 24 randomized studies utilizing Stata software (version 14). The main goal of the current study was to meta‐analytically examine the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes and the moderating effects of educational levels and intervention duration. The results indicated that AI chatbots had a large effect on students' learning outcomes. Moreover, AI chatbots had a greater effect on students in higher education, compared to those in primary education and secondary education. In addition, short interventions were found to have a stronger effect on students' learning outcomes than long interventions. It could be explained by the argument that the novelty effects of AI chatbots could improve learning outcomes in short interventions, but it has worn off in the long interventions. Future designers and educators should make attempt to increase students' learning outcomes by equipping AI chatbots with human‐like avatars, gamification elements and emotional intelligence.},

   abstract = {<p>As artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), become increasingly integrated into decision-making processes, the ability to trust their outputs is crucial. To earn human trust, LLMs must be well calibrated such that they can accurately assess and communicate the likelihood of their predictions being correct. Whereas recent work has focused on LLMs’ internal confidence, less is understood about how effectively they convey uncertainty to users. Here we explore the calibration gap, which refers to the difference between human confidence in LLM-generated answers and the models’ actual confidence, and the discrimination gap, which reflects how well humans and models can distinguish between correct and incorrect answers. Our experiments with multiple-choice and short-answer questions reveal that users tend to overestimate the accuracy of LLM responses when provided with default explanations. Moreover, longer explanations increased user confidence, even when the extra length did not improve answer accuracy. By adjusting LLM explanations to better reflect the models’ internal confidence, both the calibration gap and the discrimination gap narrowed, significantly improving user perception of LLM accuracy. These findings underscore the importance of accurate uncertainty communication and highlight the effect of explanation length in influencing user trust in artificial-intelligence-assisted decision-making environments.</p>},

   abstract = {2nd German edition. 2018. Auflage. Errata pasted on title page. Volume 2 of the complete edition contains the text of the individual edition (1927) of Being and Time with some printing error corrections and small text clarifications as well as marginal notes from Heidegger's personal copy of the second edition of 1929, the so-called "Hüttenexemplar". The marginal notes, numbered page by page in lower case letters, are printed in the footnotes. They extend from 1929 to the last years of his life.The continuation of Being and Time , the answer to the question of being itself under the title "Time and Being", was presented by Heidegger in a second attempt in the summer semester of 1927 in the lecture The Basic Problems of Phenomenology (GA 24). Being and Time as Martin Heidegger's breakthrough work and main work is at the same time the transitional work to the second, event-historical elaboration of the question of being, first in Contributions to Philosophy (On Events) (GA 65).The French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas came up with the assessment that in Being and Time "phenomenology has perhaps reached the highest point", that Being and Time "(is) a book that one can only read with Plato's Phaedrus , with the critique of pure reason of Kant and with the phenomenology of spirit of Hegel".[Publisher's synopsis]. },

   abstract = {Students’ judgements of their own learning often exceed their knowledge on a given topic. One source of this pervasive overconfidence is fluency, the perceived ease with which information is acquired. Though effects of fluency on metacognitive judgments have been explored by manipulating relatively simple stimuli such as font style, few studies have explored the effects of fluency on more complex forms of learning encountered in educational settings, such as learning from lectures. The present study manipulated the fluency of a 31-min video-recorded lecture, and measured its effects on both perceived and actual learning. In the fluent condition, the instructor used non-verbal gestures, voice dynamics, mobility about the space, and appropriate pauses. In the disfluent condition, the same instructor read directly from notes, hunched over a podium, rarely made eye contact, used few non-verbal gestures, spoke in monotone pitch, and took irregular and awkward pauses. Though participants rated the fluent instructor significantly higher than the disfluent instructor on measures of teaching effectiveness and estimated that they had learned more of the material, actual learning between the two groups did not differ as assessed by a memory test over the lecture contents given immediately (Experiment 1) or after a 1-day delay (Experiment 2). This counterintuitive result reveals an “illusion of learning” due to fluency in lecture-based learning, a very common form of instruction.},

   abstract = {The illusion of knowing is the belief that comprehension has been attained when, in fact, comprehension has failed. In the present experiment, the illusion was defined operationally as having occurred when readers who failed to find a contradiction in a text rated their comprehension of the text as high, Texts containing contradictions between adjacent sentences were presented, and readers were explicitly asked to search for contradictions, The frequency of illusions was greater when the contradictory sentences came at the end of three-paragraph texts rather than at the end of one-paragraph texts and when the contradictory information was syntactically marked as new. These results are interpreted within a framework that emphasizes that the goal of reading expository text is to establish coherence within and among sentences. In addition, the results are apparently incompatible with the notion that readers engage in active and accurate on-line monitoring of the degree to which this goal is met. This article examines an illusion that occurs during attempted comprehension of a text. Like illusions in perception , the discrepancy involves a mismatch between a subjective assessment and an objective fact. In the present case, the discrepancy is between self-assessment of understanding and objective accuracy of understanding. In particular, we will be concerned with self-assessments that demonstrably overestimate understanding. We call this discrepancy the illusion of knowing. As in perceptual illusions, a victim of the illusion of knowing is unlikely to be spontaneously aware that the self-assessment is illusory. Discrepancies between self-assessment and objective understanding are commonly reported by students, particularly when they discover they have performed poorly on an exam for which they felt well prepared. Of course, students' professions of puzzlement concerning poor performance cannot be fully credited as reflecting the illusion of knowing. Face-saving, delusion, and dis-sembling may account for a considerable number of these expressions of surprise. However, our experience as teachers suggests that even when these cases are set aside, many genuine illusions remain. If our impressions},

The older subjects studied for a while, said they were ready, and usually were, that is, they showed perfect recall. The younger children studied for a while, said they were ready, and usually were not. In another study, elementary school children were asked to help the experimenter evaluate the communicative adequacy of verbal instructions, indicating any omissions and obscurities (Markman, 1977). Although the instructions were riddled with blatant omissions and obscurities, the younger subjects were surprisingly poor at detecting them. They incorrectly thought they had understood and could follow the instructions, much as their counterparts in the study by Flavell et al. (1970) incorrectly thought they had memorized and could recall the items. Results such as these have suggested that young children are quite limited in their knowledge and cognition about cognitive phenomena, or in their metacognition, and do relatively little monitoring of their own memory, comprehension, and other cognitive enterprises (see, e.g., Brown, 1978; Fla-vell, 1978; Flavell & Wellman, 1977; Kreutzer, Leonard, & Flavell, 1975; Flavell, Note 1, Note 2, Note 3; Markman, Note 4). Investigators have recently concluded that metacognition plays an important role in oral communication of information , oral persuasion, oral comprehension, reading comprehension, writing, language acquisition, attention , memory, problem solving, social cognition, and, various types of self-control and self-instruction ; there are also clear indications that ideas about metacognition are beginning to make contact with similar ideas in the areas of social learning theory, cognitive behavior modification, per-sonalty development, and education (Flavell, Note 1, Note 2, Note 3).

The AIME was defined as the number of nonautomatic mental elaborations applied to material and measured by learners' self-reports. It was hypothesized that in the absence of instructions AIME expended in elaborating materials varies as a function of initial perceptions even when the material warrants otherwise. Television and print were considered categories for which children have general perceptions. Sixth graders (n = 124) were tested for their perceptions of self-efficacy with print and TV, perceived media realism , and attributions of failure and success with each medium. Half the subjects viewed a silent film, the other half read a comparable text. Measures of AIME and achievement were then taken. As expected, children felt more efficacious with TV, and perceived it as more realistic and easy. Print was reported to demand more effort, but led to better inference making. Efficacy correlated positively with AIME in print and negatively in TV. The discussion focuses on the roles of a priori perceptions and AIME in learning.},

Research has focused on improving recognition and accuracy by accommodating children's specific interaction behaviors. Understanding children's expectations of IUIs is also important to decrease the impact of recognition errors that occur. To understand children's conceptual model of IUIs, we completed four consecutive participatory design sessions on designing IUIs with an emphasis on error detection and correction. We found that, while children think of interactive systems in terms of both user input and behavior and system output and behavior, they also propose ideas that require advanced system intelligence, e.g., context and conversation. Our work contributes new understanding of how children conceptualize IUIs and new methods for error detection and correction, and will inform the design of future IUIs for children to improve their experience.},

In this paper, we analyze which factors influence the believability of the agent acting as the software assistant. We consider several factors such as embodiment, communicative behavior, and emotional capabilities. We conduct a perceptive study where we analyze the role of plausible and/or appropriate emotional displays in relation to believability. We also investigate how people judge the believability of the agent, and whether it provokes social reactions of humans toward it. Finally, we evaluate the respective impact of embodiment and emotion over believability judgments. The results of our study show that (a) appropriate emotions lead to higher perceived believability, (b) the notion of believability is closely correlated with the two major socio-cognitive variables, namely competence and warmth, and (c) considering an agent as believable can be different from having a human-like attitude toward it. Finally, a primacy of emotion behavior over embodiment while judging believability is also hypothesized from free responses given by the participants of this experiment.</p>},

Finally, we explore the mechanisms behind the initial confidence and behind overconfidence in Studies 11 and 12, and discuss the implications of our findings for the roles of intuitive theories in concepts and cognition.},

While many instructional videos feature a picture-inpicture view of instructor, it is not clear how instructor presence influences learners' visual attention and what it contributes to learning and affect. Given this knowledge gap, this study explored the impact of instructor presence on learning, visual attention, and perceived learning in mathematics instructional videos of varying content difficulty. Thirty-six participants each viewed two 10-min-long mathematics videos (easy and difficult topics), with instructor either present or absent. Findings suggest that instructor attracted considerable visual attention, particularly when learners viewed the video on an easy topic. Although no significant difference in learning transfer was found for either topic, participants' recall of information from the video was better for easy topic when instructor was present. Finally, instructor presence positively influenced participants' perceived learning and satisfaction for both topics and led to a lower level of self-reported mental effort for difficult topic.},

Our study examines whether people using AI to complete tasks can accurately monitor how well they perform. Participants (N = 246) used AI to solve 20 logical problems from the Law School Admission Test. While their task performance improved by three points compared to a norm population, participants overestimated their performance by four points. Interestingly, higher AI literacy was linked to less accurate self-assessment. Participants with more technical knowledge of AI were more confident but less precise in judging their own performance. Using a computational model, we explored individual differences in metacognitive accuracy and found that the Dunning-Kruger effect, usually observed in this task, ceased to exist with AI use. We discuss how AI levels our cognitive and metacognitive performance and consider the consequences of performance overestimation for designing interactive AI systems that enhance cognition.},

We ran a workshop study focused on ChatGPT to explore middle school girls' (N = 26) attitudes and reasoning about how genAI works. We focused on girls who are often disproportionately impacted by algorithmic bias. We found that: (1) middle school girls were initially overtrusting of genAI, (2) deliberate exposure to the limitations and mistakes of generative AI shifted this overtrust to disillusionment about genAI capabilities, though they were still optimistic for future possibilities of genAI, and (3) their ideas about school policy were nuanced.

Google search is a powerful tool for finding the answers to questions, and many children use Google search to learn more about the world around them. Google not only provides access to information about past events or general knowledge information, but it can also provide access to information about current events, i.e., events in progress that may change or develop as time passes, such as breaking news, sports scores, or election results, and predictions about future events. Cross-classified multilevel modeling revealed that all participants had a consistent preference for Google when the target question concerned past events, and that their trust in Google increased with age for questions about current events. Children were more skeptical about both informants' ability to answer questions that required future prediction, but still expressed a preference for Google in these questions. Finally, children's justifications for why they chose Google suggested that children turn to the search engine because they believe that it has access to a wide array of information. Children therefore place high levels of trust in Google search, but their trust is nuanced by the kind of information being sought.},

Results showed a clear distinction in children's communication and perception of visible human partners compared to AI. Nuanced differences also emerged in children's perceptions of hidden human partners versus AI. When physical appearance was absent, children relied on linguistic and paralinguistic cues to assess human-likeness and form perceptions, but physical appearance became a more dominant factor when available.

However, people’s actual abilities—from throwing darts and doing the moonwalk to playing an online game—do not improve after merely watching others, despite predictions to the contrary (Experiments 2–4). What do viewers see that makes them think they are learning? We found that extensive viewing allows people to track what steps to take (Experiment 5) but not how those steps feel when taking them. Accordingly, experiencing a “taste” of performing attenuates the illusion: Watching others juggle but then holding the pins oneself tempers perceived change in one’s own ability (Experiment 6).

Here, we conducted four experiments with 19–68 year old online participants to address the question of whether visuals of the instructor in online video lectures benefit learning. In Experiments 1 (N = 168) and 2 (N = 206) participants were presented with a lecture in one of three modalities (audio, audio with text, or audio with visuals of the instructor). Participants reported on their attentiveness – mind wandering (MW) – throughout the lecture and then completed a comprehension test. We found no evidence of an advantage for video lectures with visuals of the instructor in terms of a reduction in MW or increase in comprehension. In fact, we found evidence of a comprehension cost, suggesting that visuals of instructors in video lectures may act as a distractor. In Experiments 3 (N = 88) and 4 (N = 109) we explored learners' subjective evaluations of lecture formats across 4 different lecture formats (audio, text, audio + text, audio + instructor, audio + text + instructor). The results revealed learners not only find online lectures with visuals of the instructor more enjoyable and interesting, they believe this format most facilitates their learning. Taken together, these results suggest visuals of the instructor potentially impairs comprehension, but learners prefer and believe they learn most effectively with this format.

   abstract = { For conversational agents’ speech, either all possible sentences have to be prerecorded by voice actors or the required utterances can be synthesized. While synthesizing speech is more flexible and economic in production, it also potentially reduces the perceived naturalness of the agents among others due to mistakes at various linguistic levels. In our article, we are interested in the impact of adequate and inadequate prosody, here particularly in terms of accent placement, on the perceived naturalness and aliveness of the agents. We compare (1) inadequate prosody, as generated by off-the-shelf text-to-speech (TTS) engines with synthetic output; (2) the same inadequate prosody imitated by trained human speakers; and (3) adequate prosody produced by those speakers. The speech was presented either as audio-only or by embodied, anthropomorphic agents, to investigate the potential masking effect by a simultaneous visual representation of those virtual agents. To this end, we conducted an online study with 40 participants listening to four different dialogues each presented in the three Speech levels and the two Embodiment levels. Results confirmed that adequate prosody in human speech is perceived as more natural (and the agents are perceived as more alive) than inadequate prosody in both human (2) and synthetic speech (1). Thus, it is not sufficient to just use a human voice for an agents’ speech to be perceived as natural—it is decisive whether the prosodic realisation is adequate or not. Furthermore, and surprisingly, we found no masking effect by speaker embodiment, since neither a human voice with inadequate prosody nor a synthetic voice was judged as more natural, when a virtual agent was visible compared to the audio-only condition. On the contrary, the human voice was even judged as less “alive” when accompanied by a virtual agent. In sum, our results emphasize, on the one hand, the importance of adequate prosody for perceived naturalness, especially in terms of accents being placed on important words in the phrase, while showing, on the other hand, that the embodiment of virtual agents plays a minor role in the naturalness ratings of voices. },

Agency had two levels; whether the participants were told they were interacting with a human (avatar condition) or a computer (agent condition).

The less anthropomorphic image was perceived to be more credible and likeable than no image, which was more credible and likeable than the anthropomorphic image.

   abstract = {Treating a human mind like a machine is an essential component of dehumanization, whereas attributing a humanlike mind to a machine is an essential component of anthropomorphism. Here we tested how a cue closely connected to a person's actual mental experience-a humanlike voice-affects the likelihood of mistaking a person for a machine, or a machine for a person. We predicted that paralinguistic cues in speech are particularly likely to convey the presence of a humanlike mind, such that removing voice from communication (leaving only text) would increase the likelihood of mistaking the text's creator for a machine. Conversely, adding voice to a computer-generated script (resulting in speech) would increase the likelihood of mistaking the text's creator for a human. Four experiments confirmed these hypotheses, demonstrating that people are more likely to infer a human (vs. computer) creator when they hear a voice expressing thoughts than when they read the same thoughts in text. Adding human visual cues to text (i.e., seeing a person perform a script in a subtitled video clip), did not increase the likelihood of inferring a human creator compared with only reading text, suggesting that defining features of personhood may be conveyed more clearly in speech (Experiments 1 and 2). Removing the naturalistic paralinguistic cues that convey humanlike capacity for thinking and feeling, such as varied pace and intonation, eliminates the humanizing effect of speech (Experiment 4). We discuss implications for dehumanizing others through text-based media, and for anthropomorphizing machines through speech-based media.},

The development of artificial intelligence makes it possible to create such materials automatically. However, it is still unclear whether a system embedded with AI-generated virtual teachers can facilitate self-study compared with the system with merely the speech in self-study in K12. To address this gap, we conducted a user study with 56 high school students, collecting learning outcomes, user experience, and learning experience. Results showed that the virtual teacher helps to improve the student’s English learning performance both in retention and transfer. Participants reported high user and learning experience. Our findings shed light on the use of virtual teachers for self-study students in K12.},

Although this technology has raised great concerns about its misuse and harmful applications, it holds great potential to revolutionize traditional ways of teaching and learning. The use of GenAI in education has increased markedly, however, pedagogical research on this rapidly emerging technology is yet to be studied extensively. There is an urgent need to investigate the unexamined potential of this technology. Therefore, this ongoing research will explore the potential of AI-generated pedagogical agents (PA), or avatars, in instructional videos to facilitate learning. The effects of the type of PA (AI-generated, real-life human), and voice (AI-generated, human voice) on an individual's learning outcomes, cognitive load, motivation, and attention will be studied. Findings from a pilot study provide some preliminary evidence that PA appearance influences learners' retention and cognitive load, but not attention. The type of PA influenced learners' perception of the agent's ability to facilitate learning, its humanlike qualities, and its engagement level. However, it did not affect its credibility. This ongoing work will contribute to the growing understanding of the impact of AI in education, provide evidence of the efficacy of AI-generated PAs in instructional videos for learning, and narrow the gap between human-computer interaction research and education.},

This paper explores the transformative potential and ethical dilemmas of employing AI, particularly in engaging with historical primary sources. Utilizing a Delphi methodology, this study captures insights from social studies educators on AI's role in enhancing or complicating the teaching and learning process. The research reveals the transformative potential of AI to deepen historical understanding and empathy through innovative tools, yet it also underscores significant concerns about the accuracy, representation of historical events and figures, and the authenticity of educational content. This exploration presents the paradox inherent in educational AI: its ability to radically transform learning experiences with innovative tools while also threatening to obscure the distinction between historical accuracy and fabrication. The emerging capabilities of generative AI prompt vital questions concerning the legitimacy of information, trustworthiness, and authenticity in historical representation. We consider the implications of AI for pedagogy, emphasizing the need for instructional approaches that engage students in the critical analysis of complex influences shaping historical narratives and visual representations. The paper also addresses the role of AI in perpetuating or challenging historical narratives and biases. It underscores the importance of critical theory in social studies education to analyze the impact of synthetic media and conversational AI agents on students’ perceptions of history. We emphasize the need for collaboration between educators, technologists, and historians to ensure that AI tools enrich the educational landscape without compromising the integrity and complexity of historical understanding.},

   abstract = {Learning is a key motivator behind information search behavior. With the emergence of LLM-based chatbots, students are increasingly turning to these tools as their primary resource for acquiring knowledge. However, the transition from traditional resources like textbooks and web searches raises concerns among educators. They worry that these fully-automated LLMs might lead students to delegate critical steps of search as learning. In this paper, we systematically uncover three main concerns from educators' perspectives. In response to these concerns, we conducted a mixed-methods study with 92 university students to compare three learning sources with different automation levels. Our results show that LLMs support comprehensive understanding of key concepts without promoting passive learning, though their effectiveness in knowledge retention was limited. Additionally, we found that academic performance impacted both learning outcomes and search patterns. Notably, higher-competence learners engaged more deeply with content through reading-intensive behaviors rather than relying on search activities.},

Test results suggested that LLM-generated analogies could enhance student understanding particularly in biology, but require teachers' guidance to prevent over-reliance and overconfidence. Classroom experiments suggested that teachers could refine LLM-generated analogies to their satisfaction and inspire new analogies from generated ones, encouraged by positive classroom feedback and homework performance boosts. Based on findings, we developed and evaluated a practical system to help teachers generate and refine teaching analogies.

These subtle mistruths are poised to cumulatively degrade and homogenize knowledge over time. This article examines the existence and feasibility of a legal duty for LLM providers to create models that ‘tell the truth’. We argue that LLM providers should be required to mitigate careless speech and better align their models with truth through open, democratic processes. We define careless speech against ‘ground truth’ in LLMs and related risks including hallucinations, misinformation and disinformation. We assess the existence of truth-related obligations in EU human rights law and the Artificial Intelligence Act, Digital Services Act, Product Liability Directive and Artificial Intelligence Liability Directive. Current frameworks contain limited, sector-specific truth duties. Drawing on duties in science and academia, education, archives and libraries, and a German case in which Google was held liable for defamation caused by autocomplete, we propose a pathway to create a legal truth duty for providers of narrow- and general-purpose LLMs.},

During that same period, however, research on learning, memory, and metacognitive processes has provided evidence that people often have a faulty mental model of how they learn and remember, making them prone to both misassessing and mismanaging their own learning. After a discussion of what learners need to understand in order to become effective stewards of their own learning, we first review research on what people believe about how they learn and then review research on how people's ongoing assessments of their own learning are influenced by current performance and the subjective sense of fluency.

We also explored the relationships among these variables to learner characteristics, perceived usefulness of AI, and performance. Overall, our results suggest that student factors affect their baseline use of AI. In particular, students with higher self-efficacy, lower fear of failure, or higher prior grades tended to use AI less or later in the problem-solving process and rated it as less useful than others. Interestingly, we found no relationship between students' self-regulation strategies and their use of AI. Students who used AI less or later in problem-solving also had higher grades in the course, but this is most likely due to prior characteristics as our data do not suggest that this is a causal relationship.},

While system fidelity and immersive properties of virtual learning environments are frequently discussed in the literature, less often addressed is the fidelity of the social components of teaching and their inclusion in pedagogical agent design. Teaching is inherently a social process, making the social fidelity of virtual agents a potential factor affecting learning outcomes. In this paper, we explore the concept of social fidelity as it pertains to the teaching effectiveness of pedagogical agents. We define the term, distinguish two subcategories, and discuss representative examples of research in these domains. Promising avenues for improving learning outcomes with social fidelity include personalized language, politeness, personality, attention, feedback, social memory, and gestures. Key conclusions are that: Social fidelity is important to learning in non-social domains, tradeoffs exist when implementing certain forms of social fidelity, individual user differences need to be more widely considered, and more focused studies are needed to compare different levels of social fidelity to uncover how they impact learning outcomes.},

   abstract = {Empirical studies have repeatedly shown that autonomous artificial entities elicit social behavior on the part of the human interlocutor. Various theoretical approaches have tried to explain this phenomenon. The agency assumption states that the social influence of human interaction partners (represented by avatars) will always be higher than the influence of artificial entities (represented by embodied conversational agents). Conversely, the Ethopoeia concept predicts that automatic social reactions are triggered by situations as soon as they include social cues. Both theories have been challenged in a 2×2 between subjects design with two levels of agency (low: agent, high: avatar) and two interfaces with different degrees of social cues (low: textchat, high: virtual human). The results show that participants in the virtual human condition reported a stronger sense of mutual awareness, imputed more positive characteristics, and allocated more attention to the virtual human than participants in the text chat conditions. Only one result supports the agency assumption; participants who believed to interact with a human reported a stronger feeling of social presence than participants who believed to interact with an artificial entity. It is discussed to what extent these results support the social cue assumption made in the Ethopoeia approach. © 2012 Jana Appel et al.},

We found that in addition to being more persuasive than accurate and honest explanations, AI-generated deceptive explanations can significantly amplify belief in false news headlines and undermine true ones as compared to AI systems that simply classify the headline incorrectly as being true/false. Moreover, our results show that personal factors such as cognitive reflection and trust in AI do not necessarily protect individuals from these effects caused by deceptive AI generated explanations. Instead, our results show that the logical validity of AI generated deceptive explanations, that is whether the explanation has a causal effect on the truthfulness of the AI's classification, plays a critical role in countering their persuasiveness - with logically invalid explanations being deemed less credible. This underscores the importance of teaching logical reasoning and critical thinking skills to identify logically invalid arguments, fostering greater resilience against advanced AI-driven misinformation.},

However, studies have identified a phenomenon known as "hallucination" in which LLMs generate feedback that is inaccurate or non-existent. While this phenomenon has been observed in various domains, including medicine, academia, and news, its existence and implications in the context of physical exercises, particularly motor skill learning, remain unexplored. This study investigates the presence of LLM hallucinations in badminton skill learning and examines their potential impact on learning outcomes. This study aims to investigate whether LLMs hallucinations exist in the motor skill learning of physical exercises and what impact they may have. Eighty university freshmen with no prior badminton experience participated in a 16-week experiment, with 40 students assigned to the Experimental Group (EG) utilizing LLM-based applications (ChatGPT or New Bing) for self-guided learning, and 40 students in the Control Group (CG) learning under the supervision of 12 university sports teachers and 8 experts that specialized in badminton. Evaluation criteria for badminton skills were established, and assessments were conducted at baseline and 16 weeks using independent sample t-tests and paired-sample t-tests. One-way analysis of variance (One-Way ANCOVA) was employed to compare learning outcomes between the two groups. Interviews were conducted to gain insights into the causes of any observed differences in learning efficiency. Both CG and EG groups demonstrated motor skill improvement (clear: p &#x003C; 0.001; smash: p &#x003C; 0.001; footwork: p &#x003C; 0.001). CG exhibited significantly higher scores in long-distance shots and smashes in the post-test. No significant difference was observed in footwork scores between the two groups. High accordance in specific skill points among students in both groups indicated the common usage of prompts. Interviews with EG students revealed hallucinations in the text generated by LLMs, particularly in the context of "forearm internal rotation swing." LLMs exhibit hallucinations in the context of intricate motor skill learning, such as badminton, where limited corpus data is available. These hallucinations can mislead users and impact learning outcomes. Future research should explore strategies to mitigate LLM hallucinations in physical exercise learning applications.},

Participants (N=200) watched a crime video, then interacted with their assigned AI interviewer or survey, answering questions including five misleading ones. False memories were assessed immediately and after one week. Results show the generative chatbot condition significantly increased false memory formation, inducing over 3 times more immediate false memories than the control and 1.7 times more than the survey method. 36.4% of users' responses to the generative chatbot were misled through the interaction. After one week, the number of false memories induced by generative chatbots remained constant. However, confidence in these false memories remained higher than the control after one week. Moderating factors were explored: users who were less familiar with chatbots but more familiar with AI technology, and more interested in crime investigations, were more susceptible to false memories. These findings highlight the potential risks of using advanced AI in sensitive contexts, like police interviews, emphasizing the need for ethical considerations.},

We provide consistent evidence of the significant negative effect of erroneous conversational interfaces on several constructs considered in our conceptual model, such as: perceived competence, trust, as well as positive consumer responses. We also provide support to previous research findings and confirm that people employ a biased thinking across gender and this categorization also influences their acceptance of chatbots taking social roles.

   abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous capabilities in solving complex tasks, from quantitative reasoning to understanding natural language. However, LLMs sometimes suffer from confabulations (or hallucinations), which can result in them making plausible but incorrect statements1,2. This hinders the use of current large models in scientific discovery. Here we introduce FunSearch (short for searching in the function space), an evolutionary procedure based on pairing a pretrained LLM with a systematic evaluator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to surpass the best-known results in important problems, pushing the boundary of existing LLM-based approaches3. Applying FunSearch to a central problem in extremal combinatorics—the cap set problem—we discover new constructions of large cap sets going beyond the best-known ones, both in finite dimensional and asymptotic cases. This shows that it is possible to make discoveries for established open problems using LLMs. We showcase the generality of FunSearch by applying it to an algorithmic problem, online bin packing, finding new heuristics that improve on widely used baselines. In contrast to most computer search approaches, FunSearch searches for programs that describe how to solve a problem, rather than what the solution is. Beyond being an effective and scalable strategy, discovered programs tend to be more interpretable than raw solutions, enabling feedback loops between domain experts and FunSearch, and the deployment of such programs in real-world applications.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how AI-generated medical responses are perceived and evaluated by non-experts. A total of 300 participants gave evaluations for medical responses that were either written by a medical doctor on an online healthcare platform, or generated by a large language model and labeled by physicians as having high or low accuracy. Results showed that participants could not effectively distinguish between AI-generated and Doctors' responses and demonstrated a preference for AI-generated responses, rating High Accuracy AI-generated responses as significantly more valid, trustworthy, and complete/satisfactory. Low Accuracy AI-generated responses on average performed very similar to Doctors' responses, if not more. Participants not only found these low-accuracy AI-generated responses to be valid, trustworthy, and complete/satisfactory but also indicated a high tendency to follow the potentially harmful medical advice and incorrectly seek unnecessary medical attention as a result of the response provided. This problematic reaction was comparable if not more to the reaction they displayed towards doctors' responses. This increased trust placed on inaccurate or inappropriate AI-generated medical advice can lead to misdiagnosis and harmful consequences for individuals seeking help. Further, participants were more trusting of High Accuracy AI-generated responses when told they were given by a doctor and experts rated AI-generated responses significantly higher when the source of the response was unknown. Both experts and non-experts exhibited bias, finding AI-generated responses to be more thorough and accurate than Doctors' responses but still valuing the involvement of a Doctor in the delivery of their medical advice. Ensuring AI systems are implemented with medical professionals should be the future of using AI for the delivery of medical advice.},

The effects of physical embodiment remain underexplored while the consumer market for PAs shows an increase in the diversity of physical appearances of these products. We designed three fictional personal assistants with varying levels of embodied anthropomorphism. We validated that our prototypes differed significantly in levels of anthropomorphism (N = 26). We developed a set of identical videos for each device, demonstrating realistic end-user interaction across six scenarios. Using a between-subject video survey study (N = 150), we evaluate the impact of different levels of embodied anthropomorphism on the perception of personal assistants. Our results show that while anthropomorphism did not significantly affect the perception of Overall Goodness, it affected perceptions of Perceived Intelligence, Likeability, and the device's Pragmatic Qualities. Finally, we discuss the implications of the identified relationships between anthropomorphism and user confidence in embodied AI systems.},

However, these chatbots may hallucinate, or generate incorrect but very plausible-sounding information, more frequently than previously thought. Thus, it is crucial to examine strategies to mitigate human susceptibility to hallucinated output. In a between-subjects experiment, participants completed a difficult quiz with assistance from either a polite or neutral-toned AI chatbot, which occasionally provided hallucinated (incorrect) information. Signal detection analysis revealed that participants interacting with polite-AI showed modestly higher sensitivity in detecting hallucinations and a more conservative response bias compared to those interacting with neutral-toned AI. While the observed effect sizes were modest, even small improvements in users’ ability to detect AI hallucinations can have significant consequences, particularly in high-stakes domains or when aggregated across millions of AI interactions.},

   abstract = {Background: In multimedia learning environments, pedagogical agents have emerged as an innovative tool to enhance digital instruction, yet optimising their design for maximal learning effectiveness remains underexplored. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate how specific design elements of pedagogical agents, namely appearance and voice type, affect multimedia learning performance. Methods: A 2 (appearance: formal vs. informal) × 2 (voice type: human vs. engine-generated voice) between-subjects design was employed, incorporating eye-tracking technology. A total of 115 participants completed a multimedia learning module on chemical synaptic transmission. Learning outcomes were assessed using retention and transfer tests. Learner perceptions were measured across five indicators: social perception, perceived difficulty, lecture engagement, situational interest, and cognitive load. Results and Conclusions: Pedagogical agents with a formal appearance positively influenced learning outcomes, increasing fixation duration and fixation count, while reducing perceived material difficulty and intrinsic load. Agents with human voices similarly enhanced learning outcomes, increasing fixation counts, social perception, lecture engagement, and situational interest, while reducing perception difficulty, intrinsic load and extraneous load. The combination of a human voice and formal appearance produced the greatest benefits in learning performance. Meanwhile, compared to the combination of informal appearance and engine-generated voice, the formal appearance with a human voice indirectly affected learning outcomes by reducing perceived difficulty, intrinsic load and extraneous load. It also indirectly increased fixation count through enhanced social perception, lecture engagement and situational interest. These findings advance our understanding of the role of pedagogical agents in multimedia learning and offer valuable insights for designing effective instructional tools that maximise engagement and learning outcomes.},

While first results show that body movements of pedagogical agents in educational videos foster learning when they are learning-related, the impact of unrelated gestures and facial expressions is still not fully examined. This study investigated whether learning-unrelated gestures and facial expressions performed by an on-screen instructor were able to increase learning outcomes while considering differences in cognitive load and the perception of the agent. In a 2 (gestures; with vs. without) x 2 (facial expressions; with vs. without) between-subject design, data of 163 participants was collected. Results revealed that a pedagogical agent who performed both gestures and facial expressions led to better retention performances. In terms of transfer, participants performed better when they watched the agent performing gestures or facial expressions solely. In line with the computers-as-social-actors paradigm, gestures and facial expressions made the agent look more human-like. Gestures and facial expressions also led to higher perceptions of learning facilitation. In contrast to the hypotheses, implementing learning-irrelevant body movements did not cause extraneous processing.

The inclusion of pedagogical agents raises several design questions, for example on what kind of clothing the agent should wear. Further, it is not yet clear how the setting of an animated learning video (i.e., the digitally created background) affects learning. In an online experiment (N = 200), we investigated whether creating thematically appropriate clothing and setting has some added value in that it improves learning outcomes in comparison to more neutral assets. Whereas all participants acquired knowledge from the animated video, there were no main effects of clothing and setting for any of the dependent variables, but an interaction for learning outcomes ((Formula presented.)), indicating that the appropriately dressed agent worked better combined with the inappropriate setting than with the appropriate setting. Overall, given those non-significant main effects and the small effect size of the interaction, there seem to be some degrees of freedom for designers of pedagogical agents in animated learning videos. However, these degrees of freedom may be limited to at least moderate (i.e., neutral) levels of appropriateness.},

   abstract = {Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Across the world, history curriculum policy regularly attracts public debate but, as it is usually dominated by political rhetoric, the students who experience it remain overlooked as policy actors with valuable perspectives. This article foregrounds the voices of Australian secondary school students by drawing on a national online survey that asked students about the relevance of History and the reasons for choosing it as a subject in the post-compulsory years. Concerned about lagging national enrolments in post-compulsory History subjects, we argue that student perspectives provide essential insights into understanding issues related to the status and sustainability of history education. Our thematic analysis demonstrates that students position the present and the future as key touchstones to measure the relevance of History. It explores how these themes relate to prevailing discursive conditions: popular discourse around the purpose of history, young people’s sense of temporality and hope during volatile times, and the futures discourse that frames the Australian curriculum policy context. The research provides impetus for innovating history curriculum policy and education policy more broadly in ways that are responsive to students.},

Four studies focusing on well-documented psychological biases were conducted: the Halo Effect, In-Group Out-Group Bias, the False Consensus Effect, and the Anchoring Effect. Each study was designed to test whether APs respond to specific scenarios consistent with typical human responses documented in psychological literature. The findings reveal that APs can replicate these biases, suggesting that APs can model some aspects of human cognitive processing. However, the effect sizes observed were unusually large, suggesting that APs replicate and exaggerate these biases, behaving more like caricatures of human cognitive behavior. This exaggeration highlights the potential of APs to magnify underlying cognitive processes but also necessitates caution in applying these findings directly to human behavior.},

This study investigated the impact of an agent’s appearance and voice mismatch on user perception of the agent and their level of trust during a collaborative decision-making task. In a 2×2 between-subjects experimental design, participants performed an emotion recognition task while receiving recommendations from a virtual agent that either had a humanlike or robotic appearance with either a humanlike or synthesized robotic voice (4 conditions). Trust was measured both subjectively using a questionnaire and behaviorally by evaluating participants’ conformity to the agent’s input in their final decision-making. Results indicated that while the agent’s voice-appearance mismatch affected participants’ perception of anthropomorphism, it was not an influential factor in people’s trusting behavior. We discuss these results in the context of task complexity and make recommendations for future research.},

It remains unclear if people trust agents like other humans and thus apply the same social rules to human–computer interaction (HCI), or rather, if interactions with computers are characterized by idiosyncratic attributions and responses. To this ongoing and crucial debate we contribute an experiment on the impact of anthropomorphic cues on trust and trust-related attributions in a cooperative human–agent setting, permitting the investigation of interdependent, continued, and coordinated decision-making toward a joint goal. Our results reveal an incongruence between self-reported and behavioral trust measures. First, the varying degree of agent anthropomorphism (computer vs. virtual vs. human agent) did not affect people’s decision to behaviorally trust the agent by adopting task-specific advice. Behavioral trust was affected by advice quality only. Second, subjective ratings indicate that anthropomorphism did increase self-reported trust.},

Speech shadowing involves a person (the shadower) repeating vocal stimuli originating from a separate communication source in real-time. Humans shadowing for conversational agent sources (e.g., chat bots) become hybrid agents (“echoborgs”) capable of face-to-face interlocution. We report three studies that investigated people’s experiences interacting with echoborgs and the extent to which echoborgs pass as autonomous humans. First, participants in a Turing Test spoke with a chat bot via either a text interface or an echoborg. Human shadowing did not improve the chat bot’s chance of passing but did increase interrogators’ ratings of how human-like the chat bot seemed. In our second study, participants had to decide whether their interlocutor produced words generated by a chat bot or simply pretended to be one. Compared to those who engaged a text interface, participants who engaged an echoborg were more likely to perceive their interlocutor as pretending to be a chat bot. In our third study, participants were naïve to the fact that their interlocutor produced words generated by a chat bot. Unlike those who engaged a text interface, the vast majority of participants who engaged an echoborg did not sense a robotic interaction. These findings have implications for android science, the Turing Test paradigm, and human–computer interaction. The human body, as the delivery mechanism of communication, fundamentally alters the social psychological dynamics of interactions with machine intelligence.},

Paradoxically, people who made the most errors in this task were the most confident (a Dunning-Kruger effect). In Experiment 2 (N = 610 adults), we used face-space theory and participant qualitative reports to identify key facial attributes that distinguish AI from human faces but were misinterpreted by participants, leading to AI hyperrealism. However, the attributes permitted high accuracy using machine learning. These findings illustrate how psychological theory can inform understanding of AI outputs and provide direction for debiasing AI algorithms, thereby promoting the ethical use of AI.},

   abstract = {Gaze following occurs automatically in social interactions, but the degree to which gaze is followed depends on whether an agent is perceived to have a mind, making its behavior socially more relevant for the interaction. Mind perception also modulates the attitudes we have toward others, and determines the degree of empathy, prosociality, and morality invested in social interactions. Seeing mind in others is not exclusive to human agents, but mind can also be ascribed to non-human agents like robots, as long as their appearance and/or behavior allows them to be perceived as intentional beings. Previous studies have shown that human appearance and reliable behavior induce mind perception to robot agents, and positively affect attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. What has not been investigated so far is whether different triggers of mind perception have an independent or interactive effect on attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. We examine this question by manipulating agent appearance (human vs. robot) and behavior (reliable vs. random) within the same paradigm and examine how congruent (human/reliable vs. robot/random) versus incongruent (human/random vs. robot/reliable) combinations of these triggers affect performance (i.e., gaze following) and attitudes (i.e., agent ratings) in human-robot interaction. The results show that both appearance and behavior affect human-robot interaction but that the two triggers seem to operate in isolation, with appearance more strongly impacting attitudes, and behavior more strongly affecting performance. The implications of these findings for human-robot interaction are discussed.},

Literature suggests there are valid facial cues that assist us in assessing someone's health or intelligence, but such cues are overshadowed by an 'attractiveness halo' whereby desirable attributions are preferentially ascribed to attractive people. The impact of the attractiveness halo effect on perceptions of academic performance in the classroom is concerning as this has shown to influence students' future performance. We investigated the limiting effects of the attractiveness halo on perceptions of actual academic performance in faces of 100 university students. Given the ambiguity and various perspectives on the definition of intelligence and the growing consensus on the importance of conscientiousness over intelligence in predicting actual academic performance, we also investigated whether perceived conscientiousness was a more accurate predictor of academic performance than perceived intelligence. Perceived conscientiousness was found to be a better predictor of actual academic performance when compared to perceived intelligence and perceived academic performance, and accuracy was improved when controlling for the influence of attractiveness on judgments. These findings emphasize the misleading effect of attractiveness on the accuracy of first impressions of competence, which can have serious consequences in areas such as education and hiring.

In today's digital landscape, where the internet and social media facilitate the rapid dissemination of information, discerning between accurate content and falsified information presents a formidable challenge. Misinformation, often arising unintentionally, and disinformation, crafted deliberately, are at the forefront of this challenge. LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT-4, equipped with advanced language generation abilities, present a double-edged sword in this scenario. While they hold promise in combating misinformation by fact-checking and detecting LLM-generated text, their ability to generate realistic, contextually relevant text also poses risks for creating and propagating misinformation. Further, LLMs are plagued with many problems such as biases, knowledge cutoffs, and hallucinations, which may further perpetuate misinformation and disinformation. The paper outlines historical developments in misinformation detection and how it affects social media consumption, especially among youth, and introduces LLMs and their applications in various domains. It then critically analyzes the potential of LLMs to generate and counter misinformation and disinformation in sensitive topics such as healthcare, COVID-19, and political agendas. Further, it discusses mitigation strategies, ethical considerations, and regulatory measures, summarizing previous methods and proposing future research direction toward leveraging the benefits of LLMs while minimizing misuse risks. The paper concludes by acknowledging LLMs as powerful tools with significant implications in both spreading and combating misinformation in the digital age.},

Thus, it is critical to understand what helps users adequately assess the credibility of the provided information. Here, we report the results of two preregistered experiments in which participants rated the credibility of accurate versus partially inaccurate information ostensibly provided by a dynamic text-based LLM-powered agent, a voice-based agent, or a static text-based online encyclopedia. We found that people were better at detecting inaccuracies when identical information was provided as static text compared to both types of conversational agents, regardless of whether information search applications were branded (ChatGPT, Alexa, and Wikipedia) or unbranded. Mediation analysis overall corroborated the interpretation that a conversational nature poses a threat to adequate credibility judgments. Our research highlights the importance of presentation mode when dealing with misinformation.},

In this paper, we explore the effects of incorporating virtual agents into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) designs on the perceived trust of end-users. For this purpose, we conducted a user study based on a simple speech recognition system for keyword classification. As a result of this experiment, we found that the integration of virtual agents leads to increased user trust in the XAI system. Furthermore, we found that the user’s trust significantly depends on the modalities that are used within the user-agent interface design. The results of our study show a linear trend where the visual presence of an agent combined with a voice output resulted in greater trust than the output of text or the voice output alone. Additionally, we analysed the participants’ feedback regarding the presented XAI visualisations. We found that increased human-likeness of and interaction with the virtual agent are the two most common mention points on how to improve the proposed XAI interaction design. Based on these results, we discuss current limitations and interesting topics for further research in the field of XAI. Moreover, we present design recommendations for virtual agents in XAI systems for future projects.},

The latter was actually an embodied agent (a computer-controlled digital representation of a human).

Results supported Blascovich and colleague's model of social influence within immersive virtual environments. Specifically, the prediction that virtual humans high in behavioral realism would be more influential than those low in behavioral realism was supported, but this effect was moderated by the gender of the virtual human and the research participant.

Artificial intelligence-based methods of altering videos and photos (deepfakes) lower the barriers to the mass creation and dissemination of realistic, manipulated digital content. The risk of exposure to deepfakes among education stakeholders has increased as learners and educators rely on videos to obtain and share information. We field the first study to understand the vulnerabilities of education stakeholders to science deepfakes and the characteristics that moderate vulnerability. We ground our study in climate change and survey individuals from five populations spanning students, educators, and the adult public. Our sample is nationally representative of three populations. We found that 27–50% of individuals cannot distinguish authentic videos from deepfakes. All populations exhibit vulnerability to deepfakes which increases with age and trust in information sources but has a mixed relationship with political orientation. Adults and educators exhibit greater vulnerability compared to students, indicating that those providing education are especially susceptible. Vulnerability increases with exposure to potential deepfakes, suggesting that deepfakes become more pernicious without interventions. Our results suggest that focusing on the social context in which deepfakes reside is one promising strategy for combatting deepfakes.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Virtual humans have expanded the training opportunities available to healthcare learners. Particularly, virtual humans have allowed simulation to display visual cues that were not previously possible in other forms of healthcare training. However, the effect of virtual human fidelity on the perception of visual cues is unclear. Therefore, we explore the effect of virtual human rendering style on the perceptions of visual cues in a healthcare context. Methods: To explore the effect of rendering style on visual cues, we created a virtual human interface that allows users to interact with virtual humans that feature different rendering styles. We performed a mixed design user study that had undergraduate healthcare students (n = 107) interact with a virtual patient. The interaction featured a patient experiencing an allergic reaction and required trainees to identify visual cues (patient symptoms). The rendering styles explored include a 3D modeled virtual human and an AI generated photorealistic virtual human. Visual cues were applied using a Snapchat Lens. Results: When users are given a frame of reference (users could directly compare symptoms on both rendering styles), they rated the realism and severity of the photorealistic virtual human’s symptoms significantly higher than the realism of the 3D virtual human’s symptoms. However, we were unable to find significant differences in symptom realism and severity ratings when users were not given a frame of reference (users only interacted with one style of virtual humans). Additionally, we were unable to find significant differences in user interpersonal communication behaviors between the 3D and photorealistic rendering styles. Conclusion: Our findings suggest 1) higher fidelity rendering styles may be preferred if the learning objectives of a simulation require observing subtle visual cues on virtual humans and 2) the realism of virtual human rendering style does not necessarily affect participants’ interpersonal communication behaviors (time spent, questions asked).},

Among the various applications of social rules in human-agent interactions, this study focuses on the social cues signaling expertise or competence (i.e., expertise cues) that can evoke social, affective, behavioral, and cognitive responses toward the artificial agents through activation of social stereotypes or heuristics. Based on a systematic review of experimental studies featuring artificial agents with expertise cues published between 2005 and July 2021 (n = 63), this study proposed a classification model categorizing expertise cues into Demographics, Appearance, Social prestige, Specialization, Communication style, and Information quality (DASSCI). The DASSCI model can guide designers to logically devise and infuse relevant expertise cues into the designs of artificial agents. As per the computers-are-social-actors paradigm, this study also outlined the social and communication theories underpinning the implementations and effects of artificial agents’ expertise cues.

Drawing on psychological research, we evaluate perception of our agents' personalities and credibility by human viewers (N = 187). Our results suggest that we succeeded in validating theoretically grounded indicators of personality in our virtual agents, and that it is feasible to place our characters on Eysenck's scales. A key finding is that the presence of behavioral characteristics reinforces the prescribed personality profiles that are already emerging from the still images. Our long-term goal is to enhance agents' ability to sustain realistic interaction with human users, and we discuss how this preliminary work may be further developed to include more systematic variation of Eysenck's personality scales. © 2012 IEEE.},

As the result of this investigation we have produced a formalisation of believability and based on this formalisation built a computational framework focused on simulation of believable virtual agents that possess the identified features. In order to test whether the identified features are, in fact, responsible for agents being perceived as more believable, we have conducted a user study. In this study we tested user reactions towards the virtual characters that were created for a simulation of aboriginal inhabitants of a particular area of Sydney, Australia in 1770 A.D. The participants of our user study were exposed to short simulated scenes, in which virtual agents performed some behaviour in two different ways (while possessing a certain aspect of believability vs. not possessing it). The results of the study indicate that virtual agents that appear resource bounded, are aware of their environment, own interaction capabilities and their state in the world, agents that can adapt to changes in the environment and exist in correct social context are those that are being perceived as more believable. Further in the paper we discuss these and other believability features and provide a quantitative analysis of the level of contribution for each such feature to the overall perceived believability of a virtual agent.},

These stimuli allow for a better understanding of how the brain processes information in complex situations while maintaining experimental control. While avatars and androids are well suited to study human cognition, they should not be equated to human stimuli. For example, the uncanny valley hypothesis theorizes that artificial agents with high human-likeness may evoke feelings of eeriness in the human observer. Here we review if, when, and how the perception of human-like avatars and androids differs from the perception of humans and consider how this influences their utilization as stimulus material in social and affective neuroimaging studies. First, we discuss how the appearance of virtual characters affects perception. When stimuli are morphed across categories from non-human to human, the most ambiguous stimuli, rather than the most human-like stimuli, show prolonged classification times and increased eeriness. Human-like to human stimuli show a positive linear relationship with familiarity. Secondly, we show that expressions of emotions in human-like avatars can be perceived similarly to human emotions, with corresponding behavioral, physiological and neuronal activations, with exception of physical dissimilarities. Subsequently, we consider if and when one perceives differences in action representation by artificial agents versus humans. Motor resonance and predictive coding models may account for empirical findings, such as an interference effect on action for observed human-like, natural moving characters. However, the expansion of these models to explain more complex behavior, such as empathy, still needs to be investigated in more detail. Finally, we broaden our outlook to social interaction, where virtual reality stimuli can be utilized to imitate complex social situations.},

Educators inevitably transition to an educational future that embraces GAI rather than shuns it.

Due to the characteristics of personalization and real-time interactivity of GAI tools, we propose that the students–GAI interaction would affect their learning achievement through serial mediators of self-efficacy and cognitive engagement. Based on questionnaire surveys that include 389 participants as the objective, this study finds that: (1) in total, there is a significantly positive relationship between student–GAI interaction and learning achievement. (2) This positive relationship is mediated by self-efficacy, with a significant mediation effect value of 0.015. (3) Cognitive engagement also acts as a mediator in the mechanism between the student–GAI interaction and learning achievement, evidenced by a significant and relatively strong mediating effect value of 0.046. (4) Self-efficacy and cognitive engagement in series mediate this positive association, with a serial mediating effect value of 0.011, which is relatively small in comparison but also shows significance. In addition, the propensity score matching (PSM) method is applied to alleviate self-selection bias, reinforcing the validity of the results. The findings offer empirical evidence for the incorporation of GAI in teaching and learning.},

   abstract = {Some of the online explainer videos for physics present misconceptions as scientifically correct explanations. Even so, some of these videos achieve good ratings on online platforms. A possible reason is that explainer videos with misconceptions foster an “illusion of understanding”—the mistaken belief that a topic has been understood. Misconceptions close to everyday experiences might appear more attractive than scientifically correct explanations. This experimental study (N = 149 physics learners with a low prior knowledge on average, sample of convenience) was conducted to explore this effect. Two explainer videos were developed to be comparable in terms of comprehensibility and duration. The explanatory approach was the only difference between the two videos. While the experimental group watched a video introducing the concept of force using misconceptions, the control group watched a scientifically correct video. Learners from the experimental group developed an equal belief of understanding, but more misconceptions and fewer scientifically correct conceptions than those from the control group. We argue that this illusion of understanding might become problematic (a) in physics instruction because students who have watched a misleading video might regard further teaching in school as irrelevant, and (b) learners might tend to rate videos including misconceptions better on an online platform like YouTube. Future studies should examine these two possible consequences.},

   abstract = {This study aimed at evaluating how students perceive the linguistic quality and scientific accuracy of ChatGPT responses to physics comprehension questions. A total of 102 first- and second-year physics students were confronted with three questions of progressing difficulty from introductory mechanics (rolling motion, waves, and fluid dynamics). Each question was presented with four different responses. All responses were attributed to ChatGPT, but in reality, one sample solution was created by the researchers. All ChatGPT responses obtained in this study were wrong, imprecise, incomplete, or misleading. We found little differences in the perceived linguistic quality between ChatGPT responses and the sample solution. However, the students rated the overall scientific accuracy of the responses significantly differently, with the sample solution being rated best for the questions of low and medium difficulty. The discrepancy between the sample solution and the ChatGPT responses increased with the level of self-assessed knowledge of the question content. For the question of highest difficulty (fluid dynamics) that was unknown to most students, a ChatGPT response was rated just as good as the sample solution. Thus, this study provides data on the students' perception of ChatGPT responses and the factors influencing their perception. The results highlight the need for careful evaluation of ChatGPT responses both by instructors and students, particularly regarding scientific accuracy. Therefore, future research could explore the potential of similar "spot the bot"activities in physics education to foster students' critical thinking skills.},

   abstract = {This investigation examines the extent to which interactive social agent technology can influence social presence, information processing, and persuasion. Specifically, it looks at how interactive media using virtual agents can increase the sensation of social presence, or the extent to which a person feels "with" a mediated being. Using logic based on the Heuristic Systematic Model (HSM), social presence is posited to impact indicators of heuristic and systematic processing, leading to changes in attitude and intention toward a health issue. A 2 × 2 between subjects experiment was conducted (N = 125) with manipulations of interactivity (interactive or not) and source attractiveness (attractive or unattractive). Results of causal model tests suggest that interactive agents facilitate social presence leading to increased message processing, which in turn affects both attitude and behavioral intentions toward the issue of healthy blood pressure. Contrary to expectations, however, social presence with an unattractive source did not impede attitude and intentions. These findings are interpreted in light of presence, new media, and HSM scholarship. Copyright © Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.},

   abstract = {When attempting to solve a problem, humans call upon cognitive resources. These resources are limited, and the degree of their utilisation is described as cognitive load. While the number of parameters to be taken into account and to be processed by modern-day knowledge workers increases, their cognitive resources do not. Research shows that too high a load can increase stress and failure rates and decrease the work satisfaction and performance of employees. It is thus in the interest of organisations to reduce the cognitive load of their employees and keep it at a moderate level. One way to achieve this may be the application of virtual assistants (VAs), software programs, that can be addressed via voice or text commands and respond to the users’ input. This study uses a laboratory experiment with N = 91 participants comparing two groups in their ability to solve a task. One group was able to make use of a VA while the other could not. Besides task performance, the cognitive load of the participants was measured. Results show that (a) cognitive load is negatively related to task performance, (b) the group using the VA performed better at the task and (c) the group using the VA had a lower cognitive load. These findings show that VAs are a viable way to support employees and can increase their performance. It adds to the growing field of IS research on VAs by expanding the field for the concept of cognitive load.},

The impact of each voice type on learning, cognitive load, and perceptions of the virtual human were examined. The study found that the modern voice engine produced significantly more learning on transfer outcomes, had greater training efficiency, and was rated at the same level as an agent with a human voice for facilitating learning and credibility while outperforming the older speech engine.

   abstract = {Source code summarization involves creating brief descriptions of source code in natural language. These descriptions are a key component of software documentation such as JavaDocs. Automatic code summarization is a prized target of software engineering research, due to the high value summaries have to programmers and the simultaneously high cost of writing and maintaining documentation by hand. Current work is almost all based on machine models trained via big data input. Large datasets of examples of code and summaries of that code are used to train an e.g. encoder-decoder neural model. Then the output predictions of the model are evaluated against a set of reference summaries. The input is code not seen by the model, and the prediction is compared to a reference. The means by which a prediction is compared to a reference is essentially word overlap, calculated via a metric such as BLEU or ROUGE. The problem with using word overlap is that not all words in a sentence have the same importance, and many words have synonyms. The result is that calculated similarity may not match the perceived similarity by human readers. In this paper, we conduct an experiment to measure the degree to which various word overlap metrics correlate to human-rated similarity of predicted and reference summaries. We evaluate alternatives based on current work in semantic similarity metrics and propose recommendations for evaluation of source code summarization.},

While a degree of anthropomorphism may be inevitable due to the choice of medium, conscious and unconscious design choices can guide users to personify such systems to varying degrees. Encouraging users to relate to automated systems as if they were human can lead to high risk scenarios caused by over-reliance on their outputs. As a result, natural language processing researchers have investigated the factors that induce personification and develop resources to mitigate such effects. However, these efforts are fragmented, and many aspects of anthropomorphism have yet to be explored. In this paper, we discuss the linguistic factors that contribute to the anthropomorphism of dialogue systems and the harms that can arise, including reinforcing gender stereotypes and notions of acceptable language. We recommend that future efforts towards developing dialogue systems take particular care in their design, development, release, and description; and attend to the many linguistic cues that can elicit personification by users.},

This study explores students' adoption and perceptions of ChatGPT and other AI chatbots in higher education. Based on survey data from a large sample (n = 5894) across Swedish universities, the study employs descriptive statistical methods to analyze usage, attitudes, and concerns, and inferential statistics to identify relations between attitudes and usage and background variables (gender, academic level, and field of study). The results reveal broad awareness and use of ChatGPT among students, but not of other AI chatbots. More than half of the students expressed positive attitudes towards the use of chatbots in education, but almost as many expressed concerns about future use. Statistically significant differences were found across all examined grouping variables, particularly between genders and fields of study. Female students and students from the humanities and medicine consistently expressed more negative attitudes and concerns about AI's role in learning and assessment, while males and technology and engineering students showed higher usage and optimism. These findings not only validate the continued relevance of student backgrounds as a determinant of technology adoption but also expose several challenges and considerations surrounding AI and chatbot usage in education. The study supports the development of local solutions to AI in education tailored to student attributes and needs, and it provides insights for developers, educators, and policymakers.},

Participants were presented with a persuasive passage delivered by a male or female person, virtual human, or virtual character. They were then assessed on attitude change and their ratings of the argument, message, and speaker. The results indicated that the virtual speakers were as effective at changing attitudes as real people. Male participants were more persuaded when the speaker was female than when the speaker was male, whereas female participants were more persuaded when the speaker was male than when the speaker was female. Cross gender interactions occurred across all conditions, suggesting that some of the gender stereotypes that occur with people may carry over to interaction with virtual characters. Ratings of the perceptions of the speaker were more favorable for virtual speakers than for human speakers. We discuss the application of these findings in the design of persuasive human computer interfaces. AUTHOR},

   abstract = {Higher education is crucial for producing ethical citizens and professionals globally. The introduction of generative AI (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, has posed opportunities and challenges to the traditional model of education. However, the current conversations primarily focus on policy development and assessment, with limited research on the future of higher education. GenAI's impact on learning outcomes, pedagogy, and assessment is crucial for reforming and advancing the workforce. This qualitative study aims to investigate student perspectives on GenAI's impact on higher education. The study uses an initial conceptual framework driven by a systematic literature review to investigate the opportunities and challenges of AI in education. This framework serves as an initial data collection and analysis framework. A sample of 51 students from three research-intensive universities was selected for this study. Thematic analysis identified three themes and 10 subthemes. The findings suggest that future higher education should be transformed to train students to be future-ready for employment in a society powered by GenAI. They suggest new learning outcomes—skills in learning and teaching with GenAI, AI literacy—and emphasize the significance of interdisciplinarity and maker learning, with assessment focusing on in-class and hands-on activities. They recommend six future research directions – competence for future workforce and its self-assessment measures, AI literacy or competency measures, new literacies and their relationships, interdisciplinary teaching, Innovative pedagogies and their evaluation, new assessment and its acceptance.},

   abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are quickly being adopted in a wide range of learning experiences, especially via ubiquitous and broadly accessible chat interfaces like ChatGPT and Copilot. This type of interface is readily available to students and teachers around the world, yet relatively little research has been done to assess the impact of such generic tools on student learning. Coding education is an interesting test case, both because LLMs have strong performance on coding tasks, and because LLM-powered support tools are rapidly becoming part of the workflow of professional software engineers. To help understand the impact of generic LLM use on coding education, we conducted a large-scale randomized control trial with 5,831 students from 146 countries in an online coding class in which we provided some students with access to a chat interface with GPT-4. We estimate positive benefits on exam performance for adopters, the students who used the tool, but over all students, the advertisement of GPT-4 led to a significant average decrease in exam participation. We observe similar decreases in other forms of course engagement. However, this decrease is modulated by the student's country of origin. Offering access to LLMs to students from low human development index countries increased their exam participation rate on average. Our results suggest there may be promising benefits to using LLMs in an introductory coding class, but also potential harms for engagement, which makes their longer term impact on student success unclear. Our work highlights the need for additional investigations to help understand the potential impact of future adoption and integration of LLMs into classrooms.},

Most research lacks large-scale behavioral outcomes, leaving factors related to actual online support for conspiracy theories uncertain. We bridge this gap by combining the psychological self-reports of 2506 Twitter (currently X) users with machine-learning classification of whether the textual data from their 7.7 million social media engagements throughout the pandemic supported six common COVID-19 conspiracy theories. We assess demographic factors, political alignment, factors derived from theory of reasoned action, and individual psychological differences. Here, we show that being older, self-identifying as very left or right on the political spectrum, and believing in false information constitute the most consistent risk factors; denialist tendencies, confidence in one’s ability to spot misinformation, and political conservativism are positively associated with support for one conspiracy theory. Combining artificial intelligence analyses of big behavioral data with self-report surveys can effectively identify and validate risk factors for phenomena evident in large-scale online behaviors.},

Like other sectors, education also adopts AI technologies to address modern-day challenges. AI investment will grow to USD 253.82 million from 2021 to 2025. However, worryingly, researchers and institutions across the globe are praising the positive role of AI but ignoring its concerns. This study is based on qualitative methodology using PLS-Smart for the data analysis. Primary data was collected from 285 students from different universities in Pakistan and China. The purposive Sampling technique was used to draw the sample from the population. The data analysis findings show that AI significantly impacts the loss of human decision-making and makes humans lazy. It also impacts security and privacy. The findings show that 68.9% of laziness in humans, 68.6% in personal privacy and security issues, and 27.7% in the loss of decision-making are due to the impact of artificial intelligence in Pakistani and Chinese society. From this, it was observed that human laziness is the most affected area due to AI. However, this study argues that significant preventive measures are necessary before implementing AI technology in education. Accepting AI without addressing the major human concerns would be like summoning the devils. Concentrating on justified designing and deploying and using AI for education is recommended to address the issue.},

No significant differences in learning or performance were found between the group receiving the agent and the arrow and voice group. This result provides evidence for Clark's (2001) claim that learning is supported by appropriate instructional methods (in this study directing attention to and voicing key concepts), not a delivery medium (in this study an animated agent or the drawing of an arrow with voice). Clark has also argued against using expensive instructional media when lower cost alternatives achieve the same or similar learning and motivation goals. It was also found that the agent's visual appearances and social behaviors did not motivate, interest, or tutor learners better than the simple arrow with voice. Thus, this result does not support the Persona Effect (Lester, Converse, Kahler, Barlow, Stone, & Bhogal, 1997) which is derived from the hypothesis that an animated agent motivates human-computer interaction because it is perceived as more socially engaging and interesting than other attention directing and information dispensing devices, and thus leads learners to work harder and learn more.

In the commentary, it is acknowledged that GenAI’s capabilities can enhance some teaching and learning practices, such as learning design, regulation of learning, automated content, feedback, and assessment. Nevertheless, we also highlight its limitations, potential disruptions, ethical consequences, and potential misuses. The identified avenues for further research include the development of new insights into the roles human experts can play, strong and continuous evidence, human-centric design of technology, necessary policy, and support and competence mechanisms. Overall, we concur with the general skeptical optimism about the use of GenAI tools such as LLMs in education. Moreover, we highlight the danger of hastily adopting GenAI tools in education without deep consideration of the efficacy, ecosystem-level implications, ethics, and pedagogical soundness of such practices.},

   abstract = {Empirical studies have repeatedly shown that autonomous artificial entities, so-called embodied conversational agents, elicit social behavior on the part of the human interlocutor. Various theoretical approaches have tried to explain this phenomenon: According to the Threshold Model of Social Influence (Blascovich et al., 2002), the social influence of real persons who are represented by avatars will always be high, whereas the influence of an artificial entity depends on the realism of its behavior. Conversely, the Ethopoeia concept (Nass & Moon, 2000) predicts that automatic social reactions are triggered by situations as soon as they include social cues. The presented study evaluates whether participantś belief in interacting with either an avatar (a virtual representation of a human) or an agent (autonomous virtual person) lead to different social effects. We used a 2 × 2 design with two levels of agency (agent or avatar) and two levels of behavioral realism (showing feedback behavior versus showing no behavior). We found that the belief of interacting with either an avatar or an agent barely resulted in differences with regard to the evaluation of the virtual character or behavioral reactions, whereas higher behavioral realism affected both. It is discussed to what extent the results thus support the Ethopoeia concept. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, an “uncanny valley” exists in which avatars trigger aversion when they are almost but not quite realistic. We used a field study to investigate whether users had different affinity, trustworthiness, and preferences for avatars with two levels of realism, one that was close to human-realistic and one a cartoon caricature. We observed behavior, conducted one-on-one interviews, and collected survey data from SIGGRAPH conference attendees who either participated in a live discussion session between two avatars in a VR environment, or observed it via 3D VR headsets or on a large screen 2D video display. Eighteen sessions were conducted over four days, with the same person animating the human-realistic avatar and different guests animating the caricature avatars. The guests who interacted with the human-realistic avatar had a positive experience in the VR environment. The observers had positive evaluations of both avatars while acknowledging their different levels of realism. They rated the human-realistic avatar as more trustworthy, had more affinity for it, and preferred it as a virtual agent. Participants who observed the interview through VR headsets had an even stronger affinity for the human-realistic avatar and stronger preferences for it than those who observed via the 2D screen. Effect sizes ranged from medium to large. Our results suggest that it is now possible to cross the uncanny valley with human-realistic avatars rendered in real time.},

   abstract = {Generative AI (GAI) and AI-generated content (AIGC) have been increasingly involved in our work and daily life, providing a new learning experience for students. This study examines whether AI-generated instructional videos (AIIV) can facilitate learning as effectively as traditional recorded videos (RV). We propose an instructional video generation pipeline that includes customized GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), text-to-speech and lip synthesis techniques to generate videos from slides and a clip or a photo of a human instructor. Seventy-six students were randomly assigned to learn English words using either AIIV or RV, with performance assessed by retention, transfer and subjective measures from cognitive, emotional, motivational and social perspectives. The findings indicate that the AIIV group performed as well as the RV group in facilitating learning, with AIIV showing higher retention but no significant differences in transfer. RV was found to offer a stronger sense of social presence. Although other subjective measures were similar between the two groups, AIIV was perceived as slightly less favourable. However, the AIIV was still found to be moderately to highly attractive, addressing concerns related to the uncanny valley effect. This research demonstrates that AIGC can be an effective tool for learning, offering valuable implications for the use of GAI in educational settings. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Instructional videos, especially those featuring a teacher's presence, have been widely used in second language learning to facilitate learning. Producing instructional videos is costly and burdensome. Generative AI has great potential for generating educational content. What this paper adds An AI-generated instructional video (including generated lecture text, voice and appearance) demonstrated greater improvement in students' retention performance in English word learning than a traditional recorded video. Students perceived no significant differences between the AI-generated instructional video and recorded video in satisfaction, motivation, trust, cognitive load, emotions and parasocial interaction dimensions, although the AI-generated instructional video group reported slightly lower values. Despite AI-generated instructional video eliciting a significantly lower value of social presence than recorded video, it led to a reduction in cognitive load and better performance. Implications for practice and/or policy We recommend using the AI-generated instructional video in both physical and online classes for its positive effects on both learning achievement and learning experience. The findings indicate the equivalence principle in AI-generated content, highlighting that the appearance, voice and lecture text generated by current AI technology have reached a certain level of quality.},

Conversational AI models spanning education and entertainment include those specifically designed for early childhood education and care, as well as those not designed for young children but easily accessible by them. It is therefore crucial to critically analyse the ethical implications for children's well-being when a conversation with AI is just a click away. This colloquium flags the ‘empathy gap’ that characterises AI systems that are designed to mimic empathy, explaining the risks of erratic or inadequate responses for child well-being. It discusses key social and technical concerns, tracing how conversational AI may be unable to adequately respond to young children's emotional needs and the limits of natural language processing due to AI's operation within predefined contexts determined by training data. While proficient at recognising patterns and data associations, conversational AI can falter when confronted with unconventional speech patterns, imaginative scenarios or the playful, non-literal language that is typical of children's communication. In addition, societal prejudices can infiltrate AI training data or influence the output of conversational AI, potentially undermining young children's rights to safe, non-discriminatory environments. This colloquium therefore underscores the ethical imperative of safeguarding children and responsible child-centred design. It offers a set of practical considerations for policies, practices and critical ethical reflection on conversational AI for the field of early childhood education and care, emphasising the need for transparent communication, continual evaluation and robust guard rails to prioritise children's well-being.},

The construct of theory of mind has been operationalized in two different ways: as the ability to recognize the correct mental state of a character, and as the ability to attribute the correct mental state in order to predict the character’s behaviour. The Imposing Memory Task, with five recursive thinking levels, and a third-order false-belief task with three recursive thinking levels (devised for this study) have been used. The relationship among working memory, executive functions, and linguistic skills are also analysed. Results show that subjects exhibit less understanding of elevated recursive thinking levels (third, fourth, and fifth) compared to the first and second levels. Working memory is correlated with total recursive thinking, whereas performance on the linguistic comprehension task is related to third level recursive thinking in both theory of mind tasks. An effect of age on third-order false-belief task performance was also found. A key finding of the present study is that the third-order false-belief task shows significant age differences in the application of recursive thinking that involves the prediction of others’ behaviour. In contrast, such an age effect is not observed in the Imposing Memory Task. These results may support the extension of the investigation of the third order false belief after childhood.},

As a multimodal phenomenon, previous research argued that a mismatch in the expressive channels provides evidence of joint audio-video emotional processing. However, while previous work studied this from the point of view of emotion recognition and processing, not much is known about what effect a multimodal agent would have on a human-agent interaction task. Also, agent appearance could influence this interaction too. Here we manipulated the agent’s multimodal emotional expression ("smiling face" and "smiling voice", or both) and agent type (photorealistic or cartoon-like virtual human) and assessed people’s trust toward this agent. We measured trust using a mixed-methods approach, combining behavioural data from a survival task, questionnaire ratings and qualitative comments. These methods gave different results: while people commented on the importance of emotional expressivity in the agent’s voice, this factor had limited influence on trusting behaviours; while people rated the cartoon-like agent on several traits higher than the photorealistic one, the agent’s style also was not the most influential feature on people’s trusting behaviour. These results highlight the contribution of a mixed-methods approach in human-machine interaction, as both explicit and implicit perception and behaviour will contribute to the success of the interaction.},

   abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) can be seen as a double-edged weapon in education. Indeed, it may provide personalized, interactive and empowering pedagogical sequences that could favor students' intrinsic motivation, active engagement and help them have more control over their learning. But at the same time, other GAI properties such as the lack of uncertainty signalling even in cases of failure (particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs)) could lead to opposite effects, e.g. over-estimation of one's own competencies, passiveness, loss of curious and critical-thinking sense, etc. These negative effects are due in particular to the lack of a pedagogical stance in these models' behaviors. Indeed, as opposed to standard pedagogical activities, GAI systems are often designed to answers users' inquiries easily and conveniently, without asking them to make an effort, and without focusing on their learning process and/or outcomes. This article starts by outlining some of these opportunities and challenges surrounding the use of GAI in education, with a focus on the effects on students' active learning strategies and related metacognitive skills. Then, we present a framework for introducing pedagogical transparency in GAI-based educational applications. This framework presents 1) training methods to include pedagogical principles in the models, 2) methods to ensure controlled and pedagogically-relevant interactions when designing activities with GAI and 3) educational methods enabling students to acquire the relevant skills to properly benefit from the use of GAI in their learning activities (meta-cognitive skills, GAI litteracy).},

I would be more comfortable with this reality if we encouraged more evaluations with humans-in-The-loop to come up with a better characterization of when the machine can be trusted and when humans should intervene. This article will describe a homework assignment, where I asked my students to use tools such as chat bots and web search to write a number of essays. Even after considerable discussion in class on hallucinations, many of the essays were full of misinformation that should have been fact-checked. Apparently, it is easier to believe ChatGPT than to be skeptical. Fact-checking and web search are too much trouble.},

   abstract = {<p>According to a two-step account of the mere-exposure effect, repeated exposure leads to the subjective feeling of perceptual fluency, which in turn influences liking. If so, perceptual fluency manipulated by means other than repetition should influence liking. In three experiments, effects of perceptual fluency on affective judgments were examined. In Experiment 1, higher perceptual fluency was achieved by presenting a matching rather than nonmatching prime before showing a target picture. Participants judged targets as prettier if preceded by a matching rather than nonmatching prime. In Experiment 2, perceptual fluency was manipulated by figure-ground contrast. Stimuli were judged as more pretty, and less ugly, the higher the contrast. In Experiment 3, perceptual fluency was manipulated by presentation duration. Stimuli shown for a longer duration were liked more, and disliked less. We conclude (a) that perceptual fluency increases liking and (b) that the experience of fluency is affectively positive, and hence attributed to positive but not to negative features, as reflected in a differential impact on positive and negative judgments.</p>},

   abstract = {The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT in education has raised concerns that students may become dependent on AI-generated solutions, potentially stifling the development of critical thinking skills. Compounding this issue is the fact that Bloom’s Taxonomy—the widely used framework for designing educational goals—fails to address the cognitive demands of AI-assisted learning. This exploratory study presents a revised framework that incorporates AI-specific competencies, offering a more relevant model for nurturing critical thinking in an AI-driven environment. Using a conceptual approach supported by empirical evidence from MSc Marketing students’ interactions with AI tools over 4 weeks, the study found that AI can both enhance and challenge critical thinking across cognitive, affective, and metacognitive domains. Key elements such as melioration, ethical reasoning, collaboration, and reflective thinking were identified as critical for developing deeper engagement with AI-generated content. The framework proposes 12 propositions that inform future research and pedagogical strategies. This study outlines a research agenda for examining AI’s impact on cognitive development, serving as a resource for educators, policymakers, and researchers seeking to adapt teaching methods for AI-assisted education.},

   abstract = {Following Langer (1992), this article reviews a series of experimental studies that demonstrate that individuals mindlessly apply social rules and expectations to computers. The first set of studies illustrates how individuals overuse human social categories, applying gender stereotypes to computers and ethnically identifying with computer agents. The second set demonstrates that people exhibit overlearned social behaviors such as politeness and reciprocity toward computers. In the third set of studies, premature cognitive commitments are demonstrated: A specialist television set is perceived as providing better content than a generalist television set. A final series of studies demonstrates the depth of social responses with respect to computer "personality." Alternative explanations for these findings , such as anthropomorphism and intentional social responses, cannot explain the results. We conclude with an agenda for future research. Computer users approach the personal computer in many different ways. Experienced word processors move smoothly from keyboard to mouse to menu, mixing prose and commands to the computer automatically; the distinction between the hand and the tool blurs (Heidegger, 1977; Winograd & Flores, 1987). Novices cautiously strike each key, fearing that one false move will initiate an uncontrollable series of unwanted events. Game players view computers as},

   abstract = {How do social cues such as gesturing, facial expression, eye gaze, and human-like movement affect multimedia learning with onscreen agents? To help address this question, students were asked to twice view a 4-min narrated presentation on how solar cells work in which the screen showed an animated pedagogical agent standing to the left of 11 successive slides. Across three experiments, learners performed better on a transfer test when a human-voiced agent displayed human-like gestures, facial expression, eye gaze, and body movement than when the agent did not, yielding an embodiment effect. In Experiment 2 the embodiment effect was found when the agent spoke in a human voice but not in a machine voice. In Experiment 3, the embodiment effect was found both when students were told the onscreen agent was consistent with their choice of agent characteristics and when inconsistent. Students who viewed a highly embodied agent also rated the social attributes of the agent more positively than did students who viewed a nongesturing agent. The results are explained by social agency theory, in which social cues in a multimedia message prime a feeling of social partnership in the learner, which leads to deeper cognitive processing during learning, and results in a more meaningful learning outcome as reflected in transfer test performance. © 2012 American Psychological Association.},

                  and were developed in Poser 4 and implemented via Microsoft

                  of the three roles according to learner perception (N=78) and
                  actual impact on motivation and learning (N=71). The results
                  confirmed that the agent roles were not only perceived by the
                  students to reflect their intended purposes but also led to
                  significant changes in learning and motivation, as designed.
                  Specifically, the Expert agent led to increased information
                  acquisition, the Motivator led to increased self-efficacy, and
                  the Mentor led to overall improved learning and motivation.

This study investigates the feasibility and potential of an LLM-based historical simulation platform designed to balance immersive student engagement with teacher-directed customization. We developed a prototype that provides interactive historical contexts, AI-driven character conversations, and structured quests, while allowing teachers to adapt maps, characters, and content. Fifteen elementary and middle school teachers evaluated its feasibility through think-aloud protocols and in-depth interviews. Participants reported high usability and indicated benefits such as flexible customization, multi-perspective learning, and self-paced inquiry. Although concerns over AI limitations emerged, participants noted that such challenges can be addressed through appropriate instructional strategies which are currently used in-practice. This study introduces a novel instructional tool, offers insights into teachers’ perspectives on LLM-based simulations and highlights opportunities to enhance historical thinking and AI literacy.},

Around the world, a number of studies have shown that interest in S&T declines with school years. However, some divergences from the general trend have been demonstrated in certain contexts, sub-periods, or for closely related subconstructs. We administered 2,628 questionnaires to students in grades 5 through 11 in the province of Québec, Canada. The questionnaire explored many factors (including out-of-school and school-related preferences, difficulty, importance, frequency), allowing us to track these closely related variables for a seven-year period. Among others, the results show a general degradation in-school S&T factors but an improvement in out-of-school S&T variables and of interest in S&T studies and careers. S&T is perceived as increasingly difficult and valuable compared with all other subject matters taken one-on-one. Some shorter fluctuations are analysed and interpreted in comparison with the evolution of certain teaching practices.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we investigate an application of virtual reality and artificial intelligence (AI) as a technological combination that has a potential to improve the learning experience and engage with the modern generation of students. To address this need, we have created a virtual reality replica of one of humanity's first cities, the city of Uruk and populated this city with AI-controlled 3D avatars, which re-enact everyday life of ancient Sumerians in the period around 3000 B.C. Our hypothesis is that by immersing students into this environment and allowing them to learn by browsing through it and interacting with its virtual citizens can be more engaging and motivating than simply reading the corresponding history text or watching an educational video. To confirm this assumption, we have designed a study with three groups of students. One group was given a historical text about Uruk and everyday life of its citizens (created by our subject matter experts), the second group was shown a documentary video on Uruk and the third group was immersed into virtual Uruk and engaged into interactions with its virtual inhabitants. The outcomes of the study suggest that not only did people in the third group provide much more positive qualitative feedback about the learning experience, but they also showed a better comprehension of the study material by performing (on average) 20% better than the first two groups on the mini-exam that was conducted as a part of this study.},

At the same time, prospective and in-service teachers do not always have a coherent vision of this discipline, which can reflect on their students’ perceptions. This study makes use of a theoretical framework developed by Van Straaten, Wilschut and Oostdam to examine the validity and reliability of the model, and to analyse secondary and tertiary education students’ conceptions about the relevance of history using three categories: developing a personal identity, becoming a citizen and understanding the human condition. This quantitative study makes use of the RHMS questionnaire with a sample of 403 participants divided into three groups: secondary education students, pre-service teachers and undergraduate history students. After conducting a confirmatory factory analysis (CFA), a one-way ANOVA indicated statistically significant differences between the groups. While pre-service teachers and history undergraduate students obtained higher scores in all three subscales than secondary education students, fundamental differences were identified between the first two groups. A discussion is presented about the importance of initial teacher training and the necessity to reinforce notions related to the relevance of history in the formative development of prospective teachers.},

The variations among schools suggested that there are things that teachers can do to explain the purposes and benefits of school history to their pupils. The outcomes of the study also indicate that there is a case for teachers devoting more time and thought to helping pupils to understand the purposes and benefits of studying their subject in secondary school in order to improve the motivation and engagement of their pupils. The study may also have similar implications for teachers of other school subjects. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

The findings show that how pupils are taught appears to matter more than what they are taught and identifies teaching approaches that pupils considered to be particularly effective, and teaching approaches that appear to contribute to pupil disaffection and disengagement from the subject. The study also provides insights into the extent to which pupils find history enjoyable compared to other school subjects. Although the study is primarily of interest to history teachers, it may also be of interest to teachers of other subjects who have a concern for the degree of pupil engagement with their subject. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

   abstract = {Purpose - We review the interventions that promote motivation in academic contexts, with a focus on two primary questions: How can we motivate students to take more STEM courses? Once in those STEM courses, how can we keep students motivated and promote their academic achievement? Design/methodology/approach - We have approached these two motivational questions from several perspectives, examining the theoretical issues with basic laboratory research, conducting longitudinal questionnaire studies in classrooms, and developing interventions implemented in different STEM contexts. Our research is grounded in three theories that we believe are complementary: expectancy-value theory (Eccles and Wigfield, 2002), interest theory (Hidi and Renninger, 2006), and selfaffirmation theory (Steele, 1988). As social psychologists, we have focused on motivational theory and used experimental methods, with an emphasis on values - students' perceptions of the value of academic tasks and students' personal values that shape their experiences in academic contexts. Findings-We review the experimental field studies in high-school science and college psychology classes, in which utility-value interventions promoted interest and performance for high-school students in science classes and for undergraduate students in psychology courses. We also review a randomized intervention in which parents received information about the utility value of math and science for their teens in high school; this intervention led students to take nearly one semester more of science and mathematics, compared with the control group. Finally, we review an experimental study of values affirmation in a college biology course and found that the intervention improved performance and retention for first-generation college students, closing the social-class achievement gap by 50%. We conclude by discussing the mechanisms through which these interventions work. Originality/value - These interventions are exciting for their broad applicability in improving students' academic choices and performance, they are also exciting regarding their potential for contributions to basic science. The combination of laboratory experiments and field experiments is advancing our understanding of the motivational principles and almost certainly will continue to do so. At the same time, interventions may benefit from becoming increasingly targeted at specific motivational processes that are effective with particular groups or in particular contexts.},

Yet history plays a major role in the orientation on present and future. If students fail to see this, the question arises whether this is due to a lack of explicit attention in history classes on the application of knowledge about the past to the present and the future. This article explores two questions: (1) If history is to be more relevant to students, what kind of objectives should play a central role in history teaching? (2) What kinds of teaching strategies align with these objectives in history teaching? The first question is answered by means of historical and educational theory. The second is answered by exploring a number of teaching strategies that have been described in the literature, as well as a small-scale experiment conducted by the authors. This article aims at providing a basis for developing meaningful history curricula as well as for research into educational strategies which can be deployed to teach students how to make connections between past, present and future.},

Current applications of cultural heritage (CH) education present knowledge from a third-person perspective, potentially overlooking the emotional connection between users and artifacts. This paper introduces the concept of”Knowledge Actor”, which humanizes artifacts, making them natural first-person narrators of knowledge. For instance, in the game, the glazed porcelain artifact is humanized as a boy. Players evoke his memories and advance the game using key information. To gather key information, players talk with ores to solve the creation puzzle or to the map to get location details, simultaneously deducing, acquiring, and memorizing knowledge. The humanized design and generative AI capabilities seamlessly integrate puzzle-solving gameplay with educational objectives. Experimental results indicate this game design fosters emotional connections between users and artifacts, enhances learning outcomes, and improves the game experience.

A subsequent user study showed that these interactions fostered deeper inquiry, curiosity, and emotional engagement—while also revealing key limitations. From a CSCW perspective, this work expands the role of AI from task assistant to epistemic partner, contributing to ongoing discourse on how dialogic systems can support meaning-making, empathy, and co-constructed learning in educational settings.

   abstract = {The aim of this research is to investigate the educational potential of AI-powered chatbots in Social Studies learning-teaching processes. The study was conducted using embedded design, evaluated within the framework of mixed methods research. The study group consists of 78 6th-grade students studying in three different classes, along with one teacher who implemented the practices and guided the process. During the experimental phase of the study, lessons in the experimental group were taught by the practitioner teacher using an AI-powered chatbot named “SosyalciBot”. Meanwhile, lessons in two control groups were taught following the constructivist approach. At the end of the process, it was determined that the experimental group students’ post-test and permanency test scores were significantly higher than the control group students’ scores in both post-test and permanency test. In the semi-structured interviews, both students and the practitioner teacher provided positive evaluations of the pedagogical and design features of the chatbot, indicating that these features positively impacted the learning-teaching process. They also identified some shortcomings while offering suggestions for improvement. Based on the study findings, it is evident that chatbots have a high potential to contribute to Social Studies education. However, to fully harness this potential and achieve optimal effectiveness, further advancements and refinements in chatbot technology are required. At this point, it is recommended to conduct theoretical or applied studies focusing on developing chatbots with high communication capacity and explore innovative and constructive ideas regarding the integration of chatbots into educational environments.},

In contrast, virtual reality (VR) technology offers a human-centered, immersive way to present cultural heritage, creating a dynamic digital experience particularly beneficial when physical access to heritage sites is unavailable. This study investigates whether VR-based learning can enhance students' performance in cultural education compared to traditional teaching methods. A sample of 228 primary school students from Grades 5 and 6 was randomly assigned to one of two groups: a high-visual engagement group (VR with 360° video) or a low-visual engagement group (static video and textbook). The findings revealed that students in the high-visual engagement group achieved higher levels of intrinsic motivation and demonstrated greater learning improvements than their counterparts in the low-visual engagement group. Furthermore, the study identified negative user experiences as a significant factor moderating the connection between intrinsic motivation and learning outcomes. These results highlight the value of integrating VR into conventional teaching practices, showcasing its potential to enhance student engagement and improve educational outcomes in history and cultural studies.},

To achieve this objective, an assessment was carried out on the effectiveness of information technology tools in enhancing the assimilation of historical content. Additionally, a survey was conducted among students at pedagogical universities and history teachers to evaluate their proficiency in digital technologies. Conclusions were drawn regarding both the current benefits and future prospects of incorporating these technologies into history education. The study revealed that information and digital technologies play a significant role in the educational process, including the teaching of history. Common technological tools used in history education include presentation software, interactive historical maps and video-based maps, as well as virtual and augmented reality technologies that allow students to virtually explore historical locations or witness historical events. Other educational tools include history-themed computer games and emerging artificial intelligence applications. One of the key challenges hindering the widespread integration of these technologies is the limited technological literacy among current educators, many of whom lack the necessary skills and experience in using digital tools for history instruction. However, the training of new professionals and the high level of technological competence among today’s students and pupils provide promising prospects for the future. It is likely that the use of digital technologies will become an integral part of history education in the near future.},

This study explores the development and evaluation of a large language model representation of Joseph Lister (1827–1912), a pioneer of antiseptic surgery, within a retrieval-augmented generation framework. The purpose was to examine the model’s accuracy, authenticity, and reliability, highlighting challenges, best practices, and ethical considerations. Drawing on primary and secondary sources, including Lister’s writings, the model was constructed using OpenAI’s GPT-4o and refined through iterative validation. Prompts were categorized by cognitive complexity, and responses were evaluated against historical materials. The findings revealed a strong fidelity to Lister’s voice, with appropriate tone, diction, and temporal limits. Moreover, the model demonstrated behavioral control, reflective depth, and consistency across the different prompts. However, minor lapses in temporal framing and occasional embellishments were noted. The findings suggest that, when developed with care, AI-generated characters can support ethically grounded, historically sensitive learning experiences. At the same time, this approach warrants continued scrutiny and underscores the need for further interdisciplinary research and responsible implementation.},

The research was undertaken in the context of widespread concern about the effects of recent migration patterns on the cohesion of the nation-state. The outcomes show that many of these youngsters do not construe their identity in primarily national terms; their interest in the past lies mainly in areas such as family, religious, and trans-national history. Using factor analysis, it was possible to identify five profiles of historical interest which could be related to students' backgrounds. In addition to uncovering facets of history that are of interest to young people, these profiles revealed some remarkable differences. Native boys valued 'Pride and connection with Dutch-English-French history' more highly than native girls and all nonnatives. Non-native students valued 'Connection with history of migrants' more highly than natives; girls appreciated this profile more than boys. The conclusion suggests that recent attempts to revive history in primarily national terms may result in a model of school history that many students consider irrelevant. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {Virtual tutors are a promising technology, providing a rich interactive environment for children to learn in. However, the question of how they should behave in order to enhance pupils’ motivation remains unanswered. Using an embodied conversational agent platform, we tested human-computer interactions with 22 children aged 9–11 years. Children performed several numeracy exercises set by two different virtual agents. One agent provided solely verbal feedback (unimodal), while the other one combined facial expressions based on real muscle contractions with its verbal feedback (bimodal). Children then completed a perceived social support questionnaire. Qualitative and quantitative data were subjected to inferential statistical tests. Results showed that the overall duration of agent-pupil interactions varied, children found the bimodal agent more empathic, and produced significantly more correct answers. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between accuracy and mean reaction times for correct answers with the bimodal agent. The lack of a correlation for the unimodal agent is discussed in the light of empathy and motivation in social cognition.},

   abstract = {Affective pedagogical agent (PA) is an image of a character embedded in multimedia lessons with the ability to influence learners' affective experiences and learning performance. Prior studies on the effects of affective PA have shown inconsistent findings. In this study, we conducted four separate meta-analyses to address whether adding an affective PA to multimedia lessons can increase learners' retention performance, transfer performance, positive emotions, and intrinsic motivation, and to explore several moderators that may have contributed to the inconsistencies of previous studies. The research framework mainly includes introducing the concept of affective PA, reviewing research on the impact of affective PA on learning performance, emotions, and motivation, analyzing the moderators that may affect the effects of affective PA, performing a meta-analysis, and discussing the results based on the findings of the meta-analysis. We found 36 articles met the inclusion criteria. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that affective PA could increase learners’ positive emotions (k = 25, g = 0.26), improve intrinsic motivation (k = 26, g = 0.26), and facilitate learning performance (retention: k = 35, g = 0.26; transfer: k = 45, g = 0.34). Furthermore, moderator analysis found that affective PA characteristics (i.e., appearance, the number of emotional cues, and body movement) and learning materials characteristics (i.e., subject domain, pacing of presentation) moderated the effects of affective PA. We discussed these findings from different theoretical perspectives. In general, affective PA could help students be happier and more motivated to learn in multimedia learning environments.},

   abstract = {<p> Voice assistants have become hugely popular in the home as domestic and entertainment devices. Recently, there has been a move towards developing them for work settings. For example, <italic>Alexa for Business</italic> and <italic>IBM Watson</italic> <italic>for Business</italic> were designed to improve productivity, by assisting with various tasks, such as scheduling meetings and taking minutes. However, this kind of assistance is largely limited to planning and managing user's work. How might they be developed to do more by way of empowering people at work? Our research is concerned with achieving this by developing an agent with the role of a facilitator that assists users during an ongoing task. Specifically, we were interested in whether the modality in which the agent interacts with users makes a difference: How does a voice versus screen-based agent interaction affect user behavior? We hypothesized that voice would be more immediate and emotive, resulting in more fluid conversations and interactions. Here, we describe a user study that compared the benefits of using voice versus screen-based interactions when interacting with a system incorporating an agent, involving pairs of participants doing an exploratory data analysis task that required them to make sense of a series of data visualizations. The findings from the study show marked differences between the two conditions, with voice resulting in more turn-taking in discussions, questions asked, more interactions with the system and a tendency towards more immediate, faster-paced discussions following agent prompts. We discuss the possible reasons for why talking and being prompted by a voice assistant may be preferable and more effective at mediating human-human conversations and we translate some of the key insights of this research into design implications. </p>},

   abstract = {In this work, we propose an ID-preserving talking head generation framework, which advances previous methods in two aspects. First, as opposed to interpolating from sparse flow, we claim that dense landmarks are crucial to achieving accurate geometry-aware flow fields. Second, inspired by face-swapping methods, we adaptively fuse the source identity during synthesis, so that the network better preserves the key characteristics of the image portrait. Although the proposed model surpasses prior generation fidelity on established benchmarks, to further make the talking head generation qualified for real usage, personalized fine-tuning is usually needed. However, this process is rather computationally demanding that is unaffordable to standard users. To solve this, we propose a fast adaptation model using a meta-learning approach. The learned model can be adapted to a high-quality personalized model as fast as 30 seconds. Last but not the least, a spatial-temporal enhancement module is proposed to improve the fine details while ensuring temporal coherency. Extensive experiments prove the significant superiority of our approach over the state of the arts in both one-shot and personalized settings.},

We argue that these issues are mainly because of learning from the coupled 2D motion fields. On the other hand, explicitly using 3D information also suffers problems of stiff expression and incoherent video. We present SadTalker, which generates 3D motion coefficients (head pose, expression) of the 3DMM from audio and implicitly modulates a novel 3D-aware face render for talking head generation. To learn the realistic motion coefficients, we explicitly model the connections between audio and different types of motion coefficients individually. Precisely, we present ExpNet to learn the accurate facial expression from audio by distilling both coefficients and 3D-rendered faces. As for the head pose, we design PoseVAE via a conditional VAE to synthesize head motion in different styles. Finally, the generated 3D motion coefficients are mapped to the unsupervised 3D keypoints space of the proposed face render, and synthesize the final video. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of motion and video quality.},

However, such methods are challenged with large appearance variations between source and driving data, as well as require complex additional modules to respectively model appearance and motion. Towards addressing these issues, we introduce the Latent Image Animator (LIA), streamlined to animate high-resolution images. LIA is designed as a simple autoencoder that does not rely on explicit representations. Motion transfer in the pixel space is modeled as linear navigation of motion codes in the latent space. Specifically such navigation is represented as an orthogonal motion dictionary learned in a self-supervised manner based on proposed Linear Motion Decomposition (LMD). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LIA outperforms state-of-the-art on VoxCeleb, TaichiHD, and TED-talk datasets with respect to video quality and spatio-temporal consistency.

Existing methods face a dilemma in quality versus controllability: 2D GAN-based methods achieve higher image quality but suffer in fine-grained control of facial attributes compared with 3D counterparts. In this work, we propose StyleAvatar, a real-time photo-realistic portrait avatar reconstruction method using StyleGAN-based networks, which can generate high-fidelity portrait avatars with faithful expression control. We expand the capabilities of StyleGAN by introducing a compositional representation and a sliding window augmentation method, which enable faster convergence and improve translation generalization. Specifically, we divide the portrait scenes into three parts for adaptive adjustments: facial region, non-facial foreground region, and the background. Besides, our network leverages the best of UNet, StyleGAN and time coding for video learning, which enables high-quality video generation. Furthermore, a sliding window augmentation method together with a pre-training strategy are proposed to improve translation generalization and training performance, respectively. The proposed network can converge within two hours while ensuring high image quality and a forward rendering time of only 20 milliseconds. Furthermore, we propose a real-time live system, which further pushes research into applications. Results and experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of image quality, full portrait video generation, and real-time re-animation compared to existing facial reenactment methods.

While existing methods accurately synchronize lip movements with input audio, they typically ignore crucial alignments between emotion and facial cues, which include expression, gaze, and head pose. These alignments are indispensable for synthesizing realistic videos. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage audio-driven talking face generation framework that employs 3D facial landmarks as intermediate variables. This framework achieves collaborative alignment of expression, gaze, and pose with emotions through self-supervised learning. Specifically, we decompose this task into two key steps, namely speech-to-landmarks synthesis and landmarks-to-face generation. The first step focuses on simultaneously synthesizing emotionally aligned facial cues, including normalized landmarks that represent expressions, gaze, and head pose. These cues are subsequently reassembled into relocated facial landmarks. In the second step, these relocated landmarks are mapped to latent key points using self-supervised learning and then input into a pretrained model to create high-quality face images. Extensive experiments on the MEAD dataset demonstrate that our model significantly advances the state-of-the-art performance in both visual quality and emotional alignment.},

One explanation for these negative impacts is that the transition coincides with early adolescence, a period during which certain psychological disorders (i.e., anxiety disorders) become more salient (Kessler et al., 2005) and marked social, biological, and psychological development occurs (Anderson et al., 2000). This review evaluates the existing literature on the psychological and academic impacts of the transition to secondary education on young adolescents. We examine the factors that plausibly increase or mitigate the risk of developing mental health issues and/or a decline in academic performance during the transition to secondary education. We also review the interplay between psychological health and academic achievement across and beyond the transition.

In the second stage, we learn facial dynamics and motions from the projected audio features. The predicted motions include head poses and upper body motions, where the former is generated by an autoregressive probabilistic model which models the head pose distribution of the target person. Upper body motions are deduced from head poses. In the final stage, we generate conditional feature maps from previous predictions and send them with a candidate image set to an image-to-image translation network to synthesize photorealistic renderings.

Recent works attempt to perform motion transfer on arbitrary objects through unsupervised methods without using a priori knowledge. However, it remains a significant challenge for current unsupervised methods when there is a large pose gap between the objects in the source and driving images. In this paper, a new end-to-end unsupervised motion transfer framework is proposed to overcome such issues. Firstly, we propose thin-plate spline motion estimation to produce a more flexible optical flow, which warps the feature maps of the source image to the feature domain of the driving image. Secondly, in order to restore the missing regions more realistically, we leverage multi-resolution occlusion masks to achieve more effective feature fusion. Finally, additional auxiliary loss functions are designed to ensure that there is a clear division of labor in the network modules, encouraging the network to generate high-quality images.

   abstract = {This paper describes the design and empirical validation of
three distinct pedagogical agent roles (Expert, Motivator, and
Mentor) for college students within the MIMIC (Multiple
Intelligent Mentors Instructing Collaboratively) agent-based
research environment. The pedagogical agent roles were
operationalized by image, animation, affect, voice and script,
and were developed in Poser 4 and implemented via Microsoft
Agent. Two controlled experiments validated the instantiation
of the three roles according to learner perception (N=78) and
actual impact on motivation and learning (N=71). The results
confirmed that the agent roles were not only perceived by the
students to reflect their intended purposes but also led to
significant changes in learning and motivation, as designed.
Specifically, the Expert agent led to increased information
acquisition, the Motivator led to increased self-efficacy, and
the Mentor led to overall improved learning and motivation.
The implications for intelligent tutoring and multi-agent
system design and development is discussed.},
