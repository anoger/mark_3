Abstract

This investigation examines the effectiveness of AI-powered virtual agents
in stimulating students’ interest in history through interactive learning and
thematic alignment. Three experimental studies conducted with French sec-
ondary school students analyzed how interactivity (interactive vs. prere-
corded video) and thematic alignment of virtual agents (thematically aligned
vs. neutral) influenced interest in learning activity, historical content, and
the agents themselves. The studies were integrated into the regular curricu-
lum at three different grade levels (6th grade, 8th grade, and high school),
covering various historical periods. Results demonstrate that interactivity
significantly enhances interest across all age levels, while the effect of the-
matic alignment varies according to students’ cognitive development. Study

1 revealed that interactivity increased interest, whereas using a formally pre-

sented historical agent did not improve student engagement. Study 2 showed
that an approachably presented thematic agent significantly increased inter-
est levels, though this effect might be attributed to the presentation approach
rather than historical alignment alone. Study 3 found no significant differ-
ence between an agent representing an authority figure and one representing
a peer. These findings illuminate the complex relationship between inter-
activity, virtual character design, and developmental factors in shaping stu-
dents’ interest in historical content, offering valuable insights for designing
educational tools that leverage AI to enhance history learning.

1. Introduction

History education, with its potential for developing critical thinking and
civic understanding, plays a major role in education. Research indicated that
students often perceived history as disconnected from their daily lives and
personal experiences (Audigier and Fink, 2010). This perception became par-
ticularly significant during the transition to secondary education, as students
faced more complex historical concepts while simultaneously developing their
identity and autonomy (Evans et al., 2018), a period during which motivation
patterns often shifted (Gnambs and Hanfstingl, 2016). To support teachers
in addressing these challenges, researchers explored various pedagogical ap-
proaches and tools, including active learning methods (Roussou et al., 2024;
Petousi et al., 2022; Del Favero et al., 2007). While these approaches showed
promise, implementing them effectively in classroom settings often presented
practical challenges. Our study investigated how AI-powered virtual agents
might serve as a complementary tool for teachers, not to replace their essen-
tial role in history education, but to provide additional means of engaging
students with historical content. Our approach focused on oral interaction
with virtual agents, utilizing AI technologies for speech recognition, natural
language processing, and real-time facial animation. While previous research
had explored AI-generated characters for learning, these studies had pri-
marily employed text-based interactions (Pataranutaporn et al., 2023; Leong
et al., 2024) or text-based interfaces (Prasongpongchai et al., 2024). Build-
ing on Domagk (2010)’s work on interactivity in multimedia learning, we
leveraged recent advances in generative AI to create virtual agents capable
of dynamic conversations with students. Drawing on social agency theory
(Moreno et al., 2001; Mayer and DaPra, 2012) and research about social
cues in multimedia learning (Mayer, 2014; Sinatra et al., 2021; Sanghoon
Park, 2015), we developed these agents with features aiming at enhancing
social connection, including human-like voices (Craig and Schroeder, 2017),
expressive facial animations (Liew et al., 2017), and contextually appropriate
language. Through three experimental studies in French schools, conducted
in close collaboration with teachers as part of their regular history curriculum,
we examined how interactivity and character alignment influenced students’
interest across different grade levels. Study 1 investigated how 8th-grade stu-
dents engaged with Napoleon Bonaparte in learning about the French Em-
pire. Study 2 explored 6th-grade students’ interactions with Julius Caesar
while studying ancient Rome. Study 3 examined how high school students’
3
interest in the French Resistance was affected by interactions with either
Charles de Gaulle or a peer character. These studies allowed us to examine
how virtual agents might effectively complement existing teaching practices
and support teachers’ instructional goals across different educational levels
and historical contexts.

2.1. Interest Development in Educational Contexts

Interest serves as a significant factor in learning, combining affective and
cognitive dimensions. The affective aspect involves the experience associated
with an activity, while the cognitive aspect relates to the drive for under-
standing the subject matter. This dual nature contributes to sustained en-
gagement and knowledge seeking behavior, influencing both the quality and
persistence of learning experiences (Renninger and Hidi, 2015). Research
identifies two main forms of interest that exist along a developmental con-
tinuum (Priniski et al., 2018). Situational interest emerges as a response
to environmental triggers such as novel activities or problems presented in
the learning environment. When supported by appropriate learning condi-
tions, it may develop into individual interest, which represents a more stable
disposition toward a domain. This development reflects the transition from
externally supported to self-sustained engagement with content. According
to Hidi and Renninger’s 2006 model, the progression of interest develop-
ment follows four distinct phases. The first phase, triggered situational in-
terest, represents an initial attention response to environmental stimuli, such
as unexpected information, novel presentations, or engaging activities that
challenge existing assumptions. In the second phase, attention becomes more
sustained through meaningful engagement with content: this is referred to as
maintained situational interest. The third phase, emerging individual inter-
est, marks the beginning of a predisposition to reengage with specific content
over time. Finally, the fourth phase, well-developed individual interest, repre-
sents a relatively enduring predisposition to reengage with particular content
and a tendency to generate curiosity questions that lead to knowledge build-
ing. This conceptualization of interest differs from related constructs such as
motivation and engagement. Motivation encompasses both extrinsic forces,
driven by external rewards or pressures, and intrinsic forces emerging from
personal values and goals. Engagement describes the visible manifestation
4
of involvement in specific tasks, which can range from superficial participa-
tion to deep involvement. Interest represents a distinct psychological state
that influences both motivation and engagement patterns, characterized by
its focus on specific content and its combination of affective and cognitive
components. The theoretical understanding of interest development is signif-
icantly informed by two complementary frameworks: Cognitive Evaluation
Theory (CET) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT). The CET describes
how environmental factors affect intrinsic motivation through their impact
on perceived autonomy and competence (Deci and Ryan, 1985). The theory
posits that external events influence motivation by affecting individuals’ per-
ceived locus of causality (whether they feel their actions are self-determined
or externally controlled) and their sense of competence (whether they feel
capable of achieving desired outcomes). A key contribution of CET lies in
its understanding that events are not inherently motivating or demotivating.
Rather, their impact depends on how individuals interpret three aspects:
informational aspects that provide feedback about competence, controlling
aspects that pressure behavior, and amotivating aspects that signal incom-
petence. The SDT extends this understanding by incorporating the role of
social relationships. The theory identifies three basic psychological needs:
autonomy (the need to feel self-determined in one’s actions), competence
(the need to feel capable of achieving desired outcomes), and relatedness
(the need to feel connected to others). Learning environments foster inter-
est development when they support these needs through meaningful choices,
appropriate challenges, constructive feedback, and supportive social inter-
actions (Deci and Ryan, 2000). Research shows that intrinsic motivation
tends to decline throughout schooling, particularly during the transition to
secondary education. This period is marked not only by increased perfor-
mance pressure but also by significant biological changes and rising anxiety
levels among students (Gnambs and Hanfstingl, 2016). These multiple chal-
lenges, combined with traditional school structures that may limit natural
curiosity and opportunities for exploration (Engel, 2009, 2011), can affect
students’ engagement with learning. In history education, often perceived
as distant and disconnected from personal experiences (Audigier and Fink,
2010), developing interest presents specific challenges. Students often view
the discipline as a collection of facts to memorize rather than a process of
inquiry. This observation aligns with (Priniski et al., 2018)’s work on the
importance of personal relevance in learning, suggesting that the perceived
distance between history and students’ personal experience can be reduced
5
through approaches that promote identification and perceived utility. Re-
search on effective teaching practices reveals several approaches for foster-
ing interest development. Among these, a balance between structure and
autonomy (Jang et al., 2010), and environments promoting active participa-
tion (Cents-Boonstra et al., 2021), provide foundational support for interest
development. Additionally, (Harackiewicz et al., 2016) identify four key in-
terventions: adapting structural features of the learning environment, per-
sonalizing the learning context, implementing problem-based learning, and
emphasizing content utility. Implementing these strategies requires attention
to developmental phases. As learners progress from situational to individual
interest, instructional approaches should evolve correspondingly (Renninger
and Hidi, 2015). For instance, research indicates that secondary school stu-
dents respond more positively to interactive approaches like debates and field
studies compared to traditional didactic methods (Audigier and Fink, 2010),
suggesting the importance of active engagement in interest development. As
early as 2002, (Yarema, 2002) highlights the potential of technology-based
approaches to transform history teaching. However, merely introducing tech-
nological tools does not guarantee increased engagement or interest. Further
research is needed to better understand how technology can support the psy-
chological needs identified by the CET and SDT, and create meaningful con-
nections between historical content and student experience. One promising
approach for fostering these connections is through personalizing learning
content, which tailors educational experiences to individual student needs
and interests. The following section examines this approach in more detail.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────

2.2. Learning Content Personalization

Personalized learning emerges as a powerful approach for connecting with
students’ individual needs and preferences. This involves adapting content
and activities to align with their specific interests, prior knowledge, and learn-
ing styles. As highlighted earlier, personal relevance is a key factor in bridg-
ing the gap between abstract concepts and student engagement (Priniski
et al., 2018), and personalization directly addresses this need. Pioneering
research by Cordova and Lepper (1996) demonstrated that integrating stu-
dents’ personal information into learning contexts, such as using their names
or interests, could increase their motivation to engage with educational ac-
tivities. Even providing students with control over non-essential aspects of
learning, like choosing an avatar or visual theme, showed positive effects on
motivation. Reber et al. (2018) investigated different approaches to person-
6
alizing education, finding that interventions targeting students’ individual
interests and preferences could increase student interest in subjects often
perceived as challenging, such as mathematics and science. These targeted
interventions included adapting learning materials to students’ self-reported
interests (e.g., sports, music) and allowing students to choose examples that
connected course concepts to their personal experiences. Høgheim and Re-
ber (2015), studying mathematics education, found that allowing students
to choose examples relevant to their interests enhanced task engagement,
especially for those with initially low interest. This strategy of connecting

──────────────────────────────────────────────────

abstract concepts to personal experiences creates effective bridges for learn-

ing (Reber et al., 2009). Hagay and Baram-Tsabari (2015) demonstrated
a practical implementation of personalization by integrating students’ ques-
tions into the curriculum. Their study with secondary school science students
showed how placing student curiosity at the center of learning could enhance
classroom engagement and relationships. However, personalizing learning
presents significant challenges in implementation. Walkington and Bernacki
(2018) identified several key barriers, including the diversity of student inter-
ests, the constant evolution of these interests, and the complexity of creating
high-quality personalized content for each student. These challenges require
careful consideration to maintain educational effectiveness while pursuing
personalization strategies.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────

2.3. Active Learning

Complementing personalizing learning, active learning strategies enhance
interest and engagement by promoting deeper cognitive involvement. Active
learning encompasses pedagogical approaches where students are engaged in
their learning process through exploration, experimentation, and collabora-
tion. As Mayer (2014) and Yannier et al. (2021) note, the approach ex-
tends beyond physical activities to emphasize cognitive engagement, defined
as "actively thinking about what you are doing." This engagement mani-
fests through various forms of learning activities, including problem-solving,
group discussions, project creation, and interaction with simulations. In-
teractivity constitutes a central element of active learning (Domagk, 2010;
Evans and Gibbons, 2007). The approach enables students to regulate their
learning pace, explore concepts based on their interests, formulate questions,
and receive immediate feedback. Deslauriers et al. (2019) found that active
learning led to improved learning outcomes compared to passive methods,
although students initially perceived it as less effective. This observation
7
appeared to result from students interpreting the increased cognitive effort
required by active learning as a sign of difficulty, when it indicated deeper
information processing. Multiple studies have subsequently examined these
approaches specifically in history education. Del Favero et al. (2007) inves-
tigated active learning in history education through a comparative study of
group and individual problem-solving approaches. Their research, focused
on teaching World War I and the Italian economic boom of the 1950s, in-
dicated that students participating in group discussions demonstrated both
enhanced understanding of historical concepts and increased subject interest.
In a related study, Ijaz et al. (2017) examined the effects of immersion in an
interactive virtual world compared to traditional learning methods. Students
exploring a 3D reconstruction of ancient Uruk demonstrated improved test
performance and increased engagement with the content, spending more time
investigating historical elements and interacting with virtual characters. Re-
cent studies have further explored how digital technologies can enrich active
learning in history education. Petousi et al. (2022) examined how interac-
tive digital storytelling could support historical learning. Their study on
ancient Athens revealed that strategic decision points in historical narratives
could stimulate meaningful group discussions and deeper historical under-
standing. Students engaged actively with the content through collaborative
decision-making, helping them consider historical perspectives and contexts
more comprehensively. Extending this focus on engagement, Roussou et al.
(2024) explored how emotional connection with historical content could be
fostered in museum settings. Their "Emotions Speaking" installation demon-
strated how combining tangible interactions with emotional narratives could
encourage adolescents to engage with historical figures beyond factual knowl-
edge. By exploring multiple emotional perspectives on historical characters,
students developed stronger historical empathy and critical thinking skills.
These studies suggest that educational environments incorporating auton-
omy, participation, social interaction, and feedback mechanisms influence
student motivation and interest. The implementation of active, hands-on
experiences may help transform abstract concepts into concrete learning ex-
periences. Research suggests this active participation in learning activities
could support deeper understanding of educational content. Recent advances
in artificial intelligence technology have also created new opportunities for
interactive learning environments.

2.4. Virtual Agents: AI-driven Evolution

Virtual agents have evolved in educational research over recent decades
(Johnson and Lester), progressing from simple information delivery tools to
more sophisticated learning partners. The emergence of Large Language
Models (LLMs) has particularly accelerated this evolution, opening new pos-
sibilities for educational applications. Recent studies by (Kasneci et al.,
2023) and (Labadze et al., 2023) demonstrate LLMs’ capacity to generate
personalized responses, adapt to students’ needs in real-time, and produce
contextually relevant educational content, while acknowledging the impor-
tance of carefully evaluating their limitations. This advancement aligns with
earlier research on interactive multimodal learning environments, which em-
phasizes the importance of dialogue, control, and manipulation in promot-
ing active learning and knowledge construction (Moreno and Mayer, 2007).
Different implementations of AI-driven virtual agents have emerged across
educational contexts. Pataranutaporn et al. (2023) investigated conversa-
tional interactions with historical figures through text interfaces powered by
language models and historical data. Their comparison between interactive
dialogues and traditional text reading indicated improved motivation and
learning outcomes with the interactive approach, though the contribution
of interactivity showed mixed results in their quantitative analysis. These
observations illustrate the complexity of designing effective interactive learn-
ing experiences. In a study on financial education, Prasongpongchai et al.
(2024) evaluated how adding LLM-powered text-based interactivity to virtual
instruction could enhance learning experiences for college students. Their re-
sults showed that enabling students to engage in dialogue with the virtual
instructor through a chat interface led to improved motivation and engage-
ment compared to passive video instruction. While their findings highlight
the promise of interactive virtual agents in individual learning contexts, the
potential of collective oral interaction in authentic classroom settings remains
unexplored. This gap is particularly significant given the fundamental role of
verbal exchanges in classroom dynamics. In vocabulary learning, Leong et al.
(2024) studied content personalization using generative AI. Their system de-
veloped customized examples and narratives based on individual interests,
leading to increased intrinsic motivation and enhanced feelings of competence
and autonomy among participants. These results support earlier findings on
personalization benefits documented by Høgheim and Reber (2015). Abdel-
ghani et al. (2024) examined how AI-driven agents could foster curiosity and
knowledge exploration among primary school children. Their conversational
9
agent, designed to encourage divergent questioning, led to improved question
quality and sustained exploratory activities. These results support Moreno
and Mayer (2007)’s work on the role of interactivity and learner control in
meaningful learning experiences. Current technological advances face several
challenges. Student engagement may fluctuate over time due to novelty ef-
fects (Leong et al., 2024; Fryer et al., 2019), while questions about reliability,
bias, privacy, and academic integrity need consideration (Prasongpongchai
et al., 2024; Labadze et al., 2023; Dempere et al., 2023; Berson and Berson,
2024). Beyond establishing guidelines for integrating AI in education, re-
search opportunities exist to examine how verbal interaction with AI agents
could complement current teaching practices. The oral modality, by lever-
aging natural classroom dynamics and enabling collective dialogue, might
create different patterns of engagement compared to individual text-based
interactions.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────

2.5. Representation and Social Presence

Creating educational interactions with virtual agents requires understand-
ing how students perceive and engage with these digital entities. Research in-
dicates that effective educational interactions stem from the agent’s ability to
generate social responses from learners. Social agency theory (Moreno et al.,
2001; Mayer and DaPra, 2012) explains how social cues in virtual agents elicit
social responses in learners, leading to enhanced cognitive processing of edu-
cational content. This process, known as "ethopoeia" (Nass and Moon, 2000),
occurs even when users are consciously aware of the artificial nature of the in-
teraction. Social presence, defined as the sense of being together with another
in a mediated environment (Biocca et al., 2003), can be enhanced through
various design elements. For verbal communication, synthetic voices can be
as effective as human voices in educational contexts (Craig and Schroeder,
2017). Non-verbal elements also contribute: facial expressions must align
with context (Liew et al., 2016), and when coordinated with speech, these
expressions influence learning motivation (Liew et al., 2017). The integration
of emotional displays and warmth through both channels enhances student
engagement and perceived trustworthiness (Horovitz and Mayer, 2021; Wang
et al., 2021; Sinatra et al., 2021). This multi-modal approach is comple-
mented by communication style, where conversational approaches improve
content accessibility and adaptation to learner preferences, optimizing cog-
nitive load and motivation (Lin et al., 2020; Sanghoon Park, 2015). While
these basic social cues form the foundation of agent-student interactions,
10
their effectiveness may be amplified through thematic alignment between
the agent’s characteristics and the educational context. Schmidt et al. (2019)
demonstrated this through a comparative study where learners interacting
with a thematically aligned agent (an astronaut teaching space concepts)
showed higher levels of social presence and engagement compared to those
interacting with a neutral agent. This finding has implications for historical
education, suggesting that authentically representing historical figures while
maintaining educational effectiveness could enhance engagement. Beyond
the immediate effects of social presence and thematic alignment, these inter-
actions may foster parasocial relationships - one-sided psychological bonds
where users develop feelings of friendship, understanding, and intimacy with
media figures despite the absence of actual reciprocal interaction (Horton
and Richard Wohl, 1956). These relationships appear particularly signifi-
cant during childhood and adolescence (Calvert, 2021; Richards and Calvert,
2017), suggesting potential benefits for learning engagement. Supporting this
potential, research by Pataranutaporn et al. (2022) shows that virtual agents
representing admired figures can increase motivation. The implementation
of AI-driven historical representations involves balancing technological capa-
bilities with educational objectives. Recent research emphasizes maintaining
historical authenticity while developing engaging interactions (Berson and
Berson, 2024; Pataranutaporn et al., 2023).

──────────────────────────────────────────────────

2.6. Research Overview

Our research aims at examining the role of virtual agents in history ed-
ucation through three complementary studies, each focusing on a distinct
historical period and figure: Napoleon Bonaparte and the French Empire
with 8th graders, Julius Caesar and ancient Rome with 6th graders, and
Charles de Gaulle and the French Resistance with high school students. Us-
ing classroom-based experimental protocols, we evaluated how AI-powered
virtual agents, represented as either historical figures or neutral characters,
influence students’ interest with the learning activity, historical figures, and
lesson content. By comparing interactive dialogue and non-interactive video
conditions across different developmental stages, this research explores how
interaction mode and character representation shape students’ learning ex-
perience in history education. These investigations build upon the existing
literature, highlighting the potential of virtual agents to enhance engagement
and interest in educational settings, particularly through features that pro-
mote social presence, active learning, and personalized learning experiences.
11
Central to this potential are the capabilities of LLMs to generate contextually
appropriate and tailored responses. To further investigate these dynamics in
the context of history education, specifically through oral interactions, we
developed an experimental software tool named Memor-IA. The following
section provides further details on the technical aspects, specifications, and
functionalities of the Memor-IA software.
